				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color of Clothes and our personality by Dr. RM Mehra</p>
<p>Whatever color we pick up to wear, in some way or other is indicative of our personality. <strong>Clothes color and personality type</strong> are two terms that tell a lot about each other. Clothes and color styling says a lot about your individuality. It is interesting to know about the philosophy of colors. You must have noticed reserved people often choose to attire in sober shades, which do not flash their personality. On the contrary bold men can be often seen wearing dark bright shades that highlight their presence in the crowd.</p>
<p>Here are some generalizations about colors that will show <strong>how color of clothes affects personality</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is symbolic of dominance, passion and sensuality. It is a color meant for bold and firm men who love to lead the world. If you want to make a distinctive statement, red is the trick.</li>
<li><strong>Peach and pink</strong> shades are indicative of coolness and calm. With pink, you’ll look as fresh as a flower.</li>
<li><strong>Black</strong>, an all time favorite represents power. Acting as a symbol of elegance, versatility and grace, this color can smoothly sail in all functions.</li>
<li>If your focus is on looking neat and clean, <strong>white</strong> is just apt for you. It indicates purity and simplicity. It is the perfect summer color.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> is a color of warmth and trust. It’s a fabulous shade that can be found in almost every man’s cupboard.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> is the color of beautiful sunflower. It conveys anxiety of mind. But do not forget it is also the color of deadly fire.</li>
<li><strong>Burgundy</strong> is indicative of spirituality. It is a rich color that decides how passionate you are. Burgundy shirt looks stylish.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> comes from greenery. It is a color of nature with beautiful green leaves, fresh green vegetables. It represents freshness, relaxation and calm.</li>
<li><strong>Brown</strong> is meant for classy informal styling. It conveys reliability and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Gray</strong> is indicative of the fact that you are a balanced person in life. It looks elegant and is considered to be brainy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, decide for yourself as in which type are you judging your personality traits.</p>

<p><strong>Homes, &amp; Power of Sun- by Dr. RM Mehra</strong></p>
<p>Whenever we talk about VASTU, we refer to cardinal directions. But in actual sense VASTU is an energy based science. It is basically harmonization of energies in and around the building. VASTU has scientific fundamentals which are universal in nature and can be proved. VASTU emphasizes on staying in harmony with the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The movement of Sun, Moon &amp; Earth, effect of celestial bodies, cosmo telluric channel, geo energies, climate, wind &amp; other natural phenomena’s affect our life drastically. The energies and vibrations around us have subtle impact on the body.</p>
<h3><strong><em><u>Sun</u></em></strong></h3>
<p>Sun being the center of the solar system, governs multiple forces in it. It affects our life immensely. It is known that in summer sun rises from northeast east, in equinox from east and in winters from southeast east. Similarly it sets in northwest west in summer, west in equinox and southwest west in winters. That is why we see longer days than nights in summer.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">The fixed time of sunrise is morning whereby the fixed place of sunrise is east. Similarly the fixed time of sunset is evening whereby the fixed place of sunset is west. At the noon time the Sun is always in South with highest heat and glare. The most interesting phenomena is to observe morning in context to east, noon in context to south and evening in context to west. The most sensitive issues of life and connect are lying in connect with nature.</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>When we observe sunrise we notice high level of thermal and visual comfort in northeast throughout the day. The sun moves from northeast and slowly reaches east which is the permanent place of sun rise throughout the year. It is also important to understand, what people feel, at the time of sunrise.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12"> People, who see sunrise frequently, feel active, energetic, positive and fresh throughout the day. It is also seen that people develop better concentration and connectivity levels at the time of sunrise. Now if a building has adequate opening in north east &amp; east, the morning rays of the sun enter into the room through windows and doors and create a permanent positive environment inside. It is not just thermal comfort, visual comfort, value of light, cool air, less noise and cool albedo but infact a complete connect of self with nature. Sun also makes the northeast &amp; east part of the building active, energetic, positive, full of concentration and connectivity. This means if the building is balanced as per the laws of nature due to adequate openings in east &amp; north east of the building will be active, energetic &amp; certainly positive.</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>Sun moves and reaches southeast; almost by noon (time varies). At this point of time sun creates an irritant and unbearable heat. But the positive part of the rays of the sun is that they are disinfectant. The sunlight has high level of heat &amp; energy that makes it competent enough to be disinfectant.</p>
<p>Sun reaches southwest of the building in the early evening. West direction is the direction of setting sun which is stable, relaxing and restful. Sun does not reach North therefore they turn out to be cool zones with cool light. North direction enjoys indirect cool and diffused light of sun. It is a place for day time rooms as it is blessed with thermal and visual comfort throughout the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">Green Building Criteria’s (GRIHA- Criteria 13&amp;14) emphasize on thermal and visual comfort in context to directions.It is observed that even on the grounds of sun various room placements in a building can be done. The most important observation is creation of internal environment by Nature, and replicated impact on occupants.</div>
<div class="col-md-12"></div>
<div class="col-md-12">The objective of VASTU science is to give best to each functionality or use in a particular area for example concentration in study room, connectivity in prayer room, natural &amp; disinfectant environment in kitchen, comfort and relaxed environment in bed room and contamination free environment in bathroom &amp; toilet. This would improve the performance level of each activity and generate better level of efficiency with good results.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific VastuTM<br />
LETS LEARN FROM OUR GLORIOUS PAST<br />
VASTU is a science of harmonious manifestation of energy into matter or vice versa.</p>
<p>Art of living in harmony with the nature is Vastu science.  It’s a science because it is based on researches/calculations, database &#038; case studies considering the latitude, longitude and altitude of the place, climatology, land, location, subtle energies around and psychology of occupants.  It has been practised since Vedic times and can be followed by people of any religion.  It’s a science and not any kind of magic .</p>
<p>Balancing building with the laws of nature is known as Vastu science.  Buildings designed by Vastu should be nature friendly building and perfectly balanced withsubtle energies around and five elements and natural environment.  Vaastu was mainly known as Sthapatya Veda or the Science of architecture.  Vastu also has vas experiences and expertise of thousand of years of our ancestors on the relationship between building, nature and their effects.</p>
<p>Real Vastu – It needs a thorough scientific study of building in totality and with help of instruments, it also requires analysis of its occupants.  There are mainly three factors that are required to be taken into consideration:</p>
<p>Building – It refers to the premises and each and every aspect of the premises.  This includes the structure, openings, location, size, shape, internal layout and environment etc.  A complete internal and external study of the dwellings is important.</p>
<p>Human beings – This refers to the occupants of the building.  It refers to a complete psychological and anatomical study of the occupants.  The attitude, behavior and personality of the occupants play an important role in customized solutions.</p>
<p>Environment – Environment refers to both internal and external environment. The external environment includes the surrounding, aggressions, Climatology, cosmic and geo energies etc. The internal environment comprises of indoor air, electromagnetic field, multiple chemical sensitivity, colour scheme, materials and furniture etc.  The relationship between internal and external environment should also be clearly understood to strike a perfect balance.</p>
<p>Many of the benefits that are easily possible through efficient Scientific Vastu are:</p>
<p>Sound sleep<br />
Increased efficiency, comfort level, relaxation, concentration, and mental stability.<br />
Open mindedness.<br />
Strong immune system, better energy levels, fresh &#038; active feel and improved relationships are some of them.</p>
<p>The research scholars &#038; experts associated have differentiated themselves from the general AstroVaastu Consultants.  They have made the building fraternity realize that Architectural Vaastu science is a core subject of building sciences.  It concentrates on creating a Healthy internal environment and provides healing to the buildings through colours, plants, music’s, aromas, crystals, , paintings and design concepts.</p>

<p>Manda explores what deepening our yoga practice (or Sadhana) entails, reflecting on her own journey and seeking insight from Patanjali&#8217;s Yoga Sutras.</p>
</div>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Deepen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>to become, or to cause something to become, stronger or more powerful</em></li>
<li>t<em>o make something fuller or more complete</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sadhana</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>conscious spiritual practice</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>The focus on the physical</h2>
<h3><em>Yoga is an internal practice the rest is just a circus </em><em>~ </em><em>Sri Pattabhi Jois</em></h3>
<p>As I began thinking about what deepening our Sadhana meant I reflected on my own journey over the last thirteen years and what might be the critical distillations. I also sought some insight from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras which will follow.</p>
<p>For many of us our entry point into yoga was Asana (yoga poses). Typically, progression takes on the momentum of ‘excelling’ in certain postures, milestones are reached when we can finally touch your toes or balance in <a href="https://www.ekhartyoga.com/everything-yoga/yoga-poses/crow-pose">Crow pose</a> (see picture).</p>
<p>We might have associated deepening our Sadhana with advancing our yoga postures, i.e. getting stronger and more flexible. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion the practice of yoga is so rich and there are so many gems to be discovered beyond the physical postures.</p>
<h2>Asking the right questions</h2>
<h3><em>The style of asana practice we first embarked on might not be the asana practice that continues to serve us over the years.</em></h3>
<p>As we practise over months and years, we can go deeper by listening and responding to what the mind and body are communicating to us about the practice we are engaged in. How is our breath maintained throughout the practice? How are our energy levels sustained and regulated during our practice? Do we leave energised? Depleted? Where is our head at whilst we are practicing? Distracted? Absorbed? Do we look forward to arriving? Or are we more excited for it to be over? Is our practice a chore? Are we driven to practice out of obligation or fear? Or do we genuinely arrive on our mats grateful and excited to be there? Are we willing to question our practice, to take a step back and become curious about what experience we are having and whether the experience is beneficial to ourselves and to our relationships?</p>
<blockquote><p>Are we willing to question our practice, to take a step back and become curious about what experience we are having and whether the experience is beneficial to ourselves and to our relationships?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Motivation and intention</h2>
<h3><em>Which brings us to a fundamental question… What is yoga to you?</em></h3>
<p>What experience are you pursuing and how do your choices on and (maybe more importantly!) off the mat contribute toward your yoga?</p>
<p>Knowing your motivation and your intention keeps you on your path. It’s very easy to get distracted by the shoulds and musts, getting drawn into practices because everyone else is, flitting from one practice to another because the resistance you meet feels too uncomfortable – only to meet it again in a different guise.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s very easy to get drawn into practices because everyone else is, flitting from one practice to another because the resistance you meet feels too uncomfortable – only to meet it again in a different guise.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember acquiring book after book looking for THE answer to all my problems, somewhere between pages 20 to 50 the answer was given…. cultivating a meditation practice. Nope, that was not the answer I was looking for, so I put down one book and purchased another, THE one that would give me THE Right answer. No prizes for guessing how this played out&#8230;</p>
<h2>Taking responsibility</h2>
<h3><em>The previous question brings yet another question…. How significant are the details of the practice?</em></h3>
<p>What are the constituents or necessary ingredients for you to create your experience of yoga? How rigid or flexible are those elements? Again another open question.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I would arrive at class as a consumer with the expectation that it was the teacher’s responsibility to make yoga to happen for me, to me, even. At times I left disappointed, I didn’t work in the way I wanted to yet I was unwilling to take responsibility for my own practice in this way. TKV Desikachar’s words echo in my mind, ‘<em>Finally, I must become my own therapist’</em>.</p>
<p>When I was studying to become a yoga teacher, part of my Sadhana project and final essay was to ‘abstain’ from going to a yoga class for a month and instead develop and deepen my self-practice at home. This is what I felt my yoga needed to evolve and grow. And this is responsibility – the ability to respond to our fluctuating internal experiences, our forever changing external circumstances and identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for us to experience yoga.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is responsibility – the ability to respond to our fluctuating internal experiences, our forever changing external circumstances and identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for us to experience yoga.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Looking to Patanjali</h2>
<h3>Practice with consistency</h3>
<p>Master Patanjali offers us two core principles to apply towards our yoga practice elucidated in Yoga Sutras 1.12-1.16. Patanjali does not tell us what to do, but how to engage with our practice. The first principle is <em>Abhyasa</em>: to practice with consistency, to constantly choose the appropriate practices and exertion of effort for us to access <strong>our</strong> yoga. Once more we are met by a teaching that does not prescribe the <em>whats</em> but insists upon the <em>hows; </em>it&#8217;s about<em> </em>approach rather than technique. A consistent and sincere enquiry, questioning, curiosity and unwavering commitment to your Sadhana.</p>
<h3>Practice with non attachment</h3>
<p>The second principle is <a href="https://www.ekhartyoga.com/blog/aparigraha-practicing-non-attachment"><em>Vairagya</em></a> – non-attachment, a gradual letting go of our preferences, our likes and dislikes, the colourings that oxymoronically dull the mind. When the mind clings to something it becomes rigid and inflexible, we calcify and become narrow in our perspective. By taking an expansive and open-minded approach we experience more freedom and liberation and we are less disappointed by the outcomes of things not going our way.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the mind clings to something it becomes rigid and inflexible, we calcify, we become narrow in our perspective. By taking an expansive and open position we experience more freedom and liberation.</p></blockquote>
<p>We feel less entitled in other words: ‘what can you or the universe do for me and my preferences?’ Instead within the vastness and breadth of our non-attachment lies so much opportunity and possibility. So much room for growth and transformation. So much space for yoga to happen. What is more, a pace is implied in these teachings.</p>
<p>Patanjali does not suggest it’s a quick fix, microwavable enlightenment in biodegradable packaging. Critically, what is proposed is consistency over time and a gradual letting go and shedding of the layers of our preferences. In this way I feel the marriage and application of the two companion principles Abhyasa and Vairagya is complete and profound</p>
