				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beautiful heritage valley of Spiti is located in Himachal Pradesh, a province in India and is adjacent to Tibet. Spiti is also known as virgin mountain heaven, since one will not encounter casual tourists here. The beauty of Spiti valley has to be seen to be described &#8211; the atmosphere is serene and full of ancient Buddhist chants that provides a surreal experience, tugging at the heart strings and tempting one to stay there forever. While travelling to Spiti valley, one can see snow-capped mountains, Buddhist prayer flags waving in chilly winds, calm monasteries, and freshness in the environment, and people with purity of thought and purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain</strong><br />
It’s tough terrain has helped Spiti to maintain its tranquil atmosphere. Roads to this place are considered to be one of the most adventurous motorable roads. While travelling through Spiti valley, we would be able to visit many heritage sites and adventurous motorable passes.</p>
<p><strong>Route</strong><br />
There are two major approaches of reaching Spiti valley, these are either from Shimla or from Manali. It is considered to be advantageous to enter Spiti valley from Shimla’s side because of the basic two facts: firstly a gradually increasing altitude helps our body in acclimatization and prevents acute mountain sickness; and secondly one gets a chance to travel on Hindustan-Tibet heritage road to Tabo. While coming back, Manali side can be used as the altitude level decreases rapidly. Kaza can be a hub for staying while visiting Spiti.</p>
<p><strong>About the Place</strong><br />
Spiti valley is one of the highest energy centers where Buddhism has been preserved. Wellness seekers from all over the world visit this place in search of themselves. Inner line permit is required for foreign tourists. Food here is generally restricted to basics of Thukpa-momo or Indian breads with chicken or vegetables &#8211; these are the commonly available dishes there.<br />
One of the heritage sites is Tabo, a center of Buddhist learning which was dwelled on the banks of the Spiti river and on the cross roads of ancient famous trade route. It has one of the oldest and holiest Buddhist monastery complexes consisting of nine temples. Mud coloured walls of the shrine is a part of a monolithic structure that has paintings and statues on their walls; some of the paintings inside the monastery have been restored by the Archeological Survey of India.<br />
The largest religious training center and monastery in Spiti valley is Ki or Kye, which has also been restored by the Archeological Survey of India. This monastery has faced multiple invasions by different armies in ancient times. Gelugpa sect of Mahayana Buddhism has been running this Gompa. Again one gets a sense of the highest level of energies on visiting its prayer halls.<br />
Spiti’s traditional capital Dhankar has an old fort type monastery dating to the 16th century apart from the new one. Collection of Bhotia Buddhist scriptures, four bodied Dhyana Buddha are the main attractions there. To reach Gompa, there is a vertical climb of about 2 hours from a point 2 kms away from Gompa.<br />
Spiti may not be an ideal vacation for leisure lovers due to lack of infrastructure and harsh terrain, however, for the young spiritual and wellness seekers, it might open the gates to a flood of knowledge and assist in one’s search for a body-mind-spirit connect.<br />
Lahaul-Spiti is an another world within our world; to understand its beauty, one needs to visit it in person and savour the experience of a lifetime.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In last few months I did not take any leave form my workplace, may be because of work pressure. But then I decided that I need some time to rejuvenate. I am traveler in non-peak season where I get to see more and do more.</p>
<p>Early in the morning On 28 March in 2011, I started from my home in Delhi by road. Before moving I panned everything about where do I need to take halt and where would I camp.</p>
<p>On the same day after a drive of 3 hrs. I took 1<sup>st</sup> halt to have a cup of tea and after almost 6 hrs. I reached Haridwar. I was really tired and wanted to fee fresh to continue my journey till Rudraprayag. What else could have saved me other than the mark of purity river “Ganga”?  I took a dip in the chilled water coming from Himalayas and prayed River Ganga to bless my journey. This experience has always been majestic for me.</p>
<p>Now before starting my 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the travel on day 1 I took light lunch fruits and fresh juice in lunch with a small pack of McVities Digestives Biscuit. After completing the long painful journey of plains in Uttar Pradesh, taking multiple dips in ever flowing chilled water of river Ganges I entered foothills of Himalayas in Rishikesh. While enjoying the scenic beauty of Uttrakhand and adoring the fresh air coming from green trees with musical waves of Ganga I reached my 1<sup>st</sup> hat at Rudraprayag. It was a campsite for rafting, but because of Ganga flowing above danger mark, all camps were moved to a higher ground. I was so depressed that I will not be able to see the flowing river, but in the night when I was sitting at the cliff, I could see the flowing river at the bottom and dark blue sky with millions… trillions stars in the sky with tall trees beside me and the cool breeze giving me Goosebumps. I fell in love with nature all over again. I was so relaxed that I started to think about what have I missed in my life till now and what should I do to keep it on track.</p>
<p>On Day 2, early morning after bread, butter, poha and tea I left for my resort in Joshimath, with 1 halt in the midway for light lunch. When I reached there the sun was also getting tired and pulling him down. Quickly I went in my cottage freshened up and came out for a cup of tea. Ooo the place was so beautifullllll that I can’t explain in words, the only thing that I can think of it is “it took my breath away”. My chair was completely surrounded by deodar tress and snowcapped peaks. I can clearly see the piles of snow covered “Valley of Flowers” and the route to reach “Roopkund” &amp; “Hemkund Sahib”. I was so curious to touch the peak that I quickly had my dinner and went to bed. The room was so nicely designed that can see the snow clapped peaks clearly in moonlight from my bed.  Ooo I realized that I had to sleep and relax my body and mind so that I climb up the peak tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Day 3- Last night I was able to sleep properly and in the morning I was ready with my gear, my climbing shoes, jacket, water bottle and some snacks. Before stepping out I asked the local person in the hotel about the path to be taken to reach Gurso Bugyal. Before taking the first step on the route I prayed to “Maa Shakti” to give me strength to reach to the top and achieve my goal. I started to walk and climb and walk and climb up the stony and slippery path because of fallen and decaying leaves… Ooo I was so tired after just walking for 500 mtrs that I once thought to give up as I can’t walk anymore, but then I realized that I was going to give up on my dream and if I gave up I will never be able to climb again. I gathered all my strength and once again prayed to give me strength. She gave me strength earlier and now also as I started to walk. I started to talk to the birds and trees. I first crossed the GMVN resorts and then after walking for some more time i reached the man-made lake in “Hotel Clifftop Club”. I took rest for a while took my energy bar and then started to walk again. As I was climbing up the path was becoming more slippery because of melting snow and getting mixed with soil and decaying leaves. After some time I crossed the woods and reached the grassy trek. The sun was shining bright and I reached at the top by the afternoon. I was so happy that I can’t tell you, I started to play with the snow and laughed and shouted and I took my picks tooo to show my family. I lied on the “Gurso Bugyal” which means the meadow of grass and also sat for some time to control my happiness …. Ooo I had to get down before sunset otherwise and reach my resort.  I started to walk again and after taking some rest again I walked and reached my resort. I was so tired that I quickly had my dinner and slept with the memory of the picturesque Gurso in my eyes as “Mission accomplished”</p>
<p>Day – 4 I woke up late in the morning had bath and took my breakfast. It was sad but the moment has come to go back home. My taxi had come to take me back home. Buuuhuuuuu… I will miss you my “Gurso”. I was still so tired that I slept in the taxi and my driver dropped me home by Day 5 2:00am.</p>
<p>“I will miss you Gurso Bugyal”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>River Ganga is the longest river in India and one amongst the longest river of the world. It originates as a pure source of water from Himalayas and after travelling a huge course of land merges into Bay of Bengal. It is the river that has made civilization of Northern and Eastern India flourish. In Hinduism River Ganga is regarded as Goddess and therefore called as <strong>“Ganga Ji” or “Ganga Mata”-Mother Ganga</strong>. It is believed that the holy water of River Ganga has purifying and sanctifying virtues. At Haridwar, one can see huge crowds taking bath in River Ganga to get the divine blessings. Just before entering Haridwar, River Ganga crosses a valley town called as Rishikesh where one can come across people meditating, performing yoga, and yagnas on mountainous banks of River Ganga. One feels refreshed after spending time on banks of River Ganga at Rishikesh.<br />
In today’s world, despite being so holy River Ganga faces a major problem of pollution. Bank erosion is one of the prominent features due to urbanisation and felling of tree. As it leaves mountains and crosses towns and cities, wastes from homes, industries find its way into River Ganga.<br />
Present Indian government led by Prime Minister of India, Shree Narender Modi has launched a mission called “Namami Gange” (that means “We bow to you, Ganga” in Sanskrit) which is an integrated Ganga conservation that will consolidate existing ongoing efforts and planning on Ganga rejuvenation.<br />
A special “Clean Ganga Fund” has been setup to finance various activities. This includes R &amp; D as well as innovative pilot projects for new technology and processes for river purification and conservation.<br />
We at 360° Wellness Solutions intend to promote the cleaning and saving of River Ganga by increasing the awareness of local people and visitors and participating in different efforts being done by various organisations.<br />
If you we wish to donate a token amount of money that would help the initiative further, we would request you to visit the following link setup the Indian Government.<br />
https://nmcg.nic.in/NamamiGanga.aspx<br />
Let us all take a resolution of protecting the most pious River Ganga from pollution so that future generations should also be able to experience and enjoy the blessings and benefits being given by River Ganga.</p>

Come close to Nature to know what it has to offer with it mountain trekking, walking in the woods , yoga in clean air, massage with natural oils, nourish and cleanse with healthy vegetarian food and relax.<br />
Nature walk and treks help your body to rejuvenate; you take it as a sport or hobby or weight loss mechanism or body strengthener. I have seen enough trekker to hear their soul and attain peace. We walk to help our body learn what it has lost in the busy city life and feel calm and distress you. Come walk with us to get to a world where you enter without a password, where you follow you heart and instincts other than directions, where you filter your thoughts and decisions not people and time, where you make friends to talk for hours maybe without getting a reply for hours like I talk to birds, play to feel happy and relaxed. This life is more important than time not your timeline and its your life not a machine to scroll and choose what you like and hated the most.<br />
Nature has saved a lot of things for you so come and Enjoy .</p>
<blockquote><p>Sir Edmund Hillary said “It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves”. We don’t walk because we can; we walk because we want to.</p></blockquote>
