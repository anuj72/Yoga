Well-being activities like yoga, meditation, silent walking, and more, work on the premise that they help in creating an inner spiritual connect with one’s own self and promote time for one’s own self.<br />
For our guests from Israel, we propose to have the following services available soon**:<br />
· No non-Shabbat food in the room of the guest.</p>
<p>· No phone calls to the guest room post afternoon</p>
<p>· No wellness treatments from afternoon (Friday) till next day afternoon (Saturday)</p>
<p>· Provision of Special bread (Challah).</p>
<p>· Provision for Scaled fish stew (Cholent)</p>
<p>· Food to be prepared before sunset and placed in hot plates – food not to be removed from the hot plates or reheated; hot food is served hot and cold food cold.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colour therapy is as old as any other medicine in oldest civilizations and has been used in India, Egypt, Greece, and China. It is believed to have been investigated as medicine since 2000 BC. In that age society might have been unaware of colour’s effect as a medicine, but surely had faith in healing with colours. Primary colours red, blue and yellow were used for healing. The science seems to have been silent at those times.</p>
<p>It is believed that body’s seven chakras are related to the seven colours of the rainbow. Therefore, it is believed that if harmony of colours is disturbed in the body it leads to disorders in the body, and after getting diagnosed by a colour therapist that particular disorder can be treated by appropriate spectrum of colours. Here light moves in waves of varying lengths and, as each colour has a different wavelength and a particular spectrum is focussed on. This is done in a specially designed rooms by throwing that of colours on walls, by shoning up light on skin, treating water in glass bottles with colours, or may be through small torches.</p>
<p>Evidence of colour therapy has been seen on mood and general well being. Robert Gerard in 1958 conducted a study that showed the power of stimulation by red and makes anxious and affected appetite, blood pressure, and aggression; while blue promoted calmness.</p>
<p>Ghadiali research stated “The colour bands of spectrograms are produced when a chemical element undergoes a process of combustion or vaporization that accelerates the motion of its atoms. The specific band of colours and dark lines emitted when a certain element is heated, are known as Fraunhauafer.” He also found that “by treating the body with a particular colour vibration, one could effectively reintroduce the appropriate biochemical elements into the body; he referred to this as colour chemistry, certainly a new field of study. His results as published in the first decade of the twentieth century were advocated by Klotsche (1) in Colour Medicine: colour medicine not only can heal the diseased frequency of the body but also can introduce actual chemical elements/vibration into the body in a non-toxic form.”</p>
<p>Journal published by Samina T. Yousuf Azeemi and S. Mohsin Raza states “Chromotherapy as a system of treatment can benefit people because of its harmony with nature. Everything that exists in this world is a combination of different colours”</p>
<p>Consultant psychologist Ingrid Collins states “We know that the cells of the human body are constructed from atoms and that each atom consists of particles of energy in constant motion. We are therefore at the most fundamental level made of energy and information, so when we add a particular colour we are adding energy into our lives.”</p>
<p>It is being used in Texas, there inmates are dressed in pink to reduce aggression. It is being widely used for treating insomnia, stress, immune deficiency problems, and also for critical illness. People who have been through this therapy states that after the therapy there is a feeling freshness and many have been helped in case of insomnia.</p>
<p>Explore colours deeply and get rejuvenated!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>“Human that cannot be still will be ill”</h1>
<h2>Human Thougths</h2>
<p>In today’s fast moving world, human thoughts are so much engrossed in technology and fast moving lifestyle. We forget the kind of life, we have been given by divine or nature.  We always needs something much more important than this technology and fast moving lifestyle. Our physical health depends completely on our psychological health. Stillness improves our mental health and thereby our physical health. For example, Tortoise are slow moving animals, and lives a long life, looks like they have stillness and also they complete within themselves.</p>
<h2>Thyroid</h2>
<p>Now talking about this Thyroid hormone, we can say that this hormone is responsible for many things that maintain balance in the body. For example, it is responsible for maintaining the metabolism, sleep cycle, brain activities and/or the bone maintenance. To keep it healthy few major things are required to be done by humans.</p>
<p>Firstly, <strong>relieve yourself from getting engrossed with technology and slow down </strong>and focus on what you have been doing till now. Start having more control on yourself and let your soul take control of your body and not the vice versa. <strong>Start focussing on your breath and breathe deeply and slowly, so that Thyroid gland is released from the pressure </strong>of generating the required hormones extremely quickly. Always keep an extra margin in time while going for some work or commitment so that you don’t get stressed and breathing does not disturbed.</p>
<p>Secondly, let your <strong>body and eyes interact with early morning sunlight</strong>, since apart from providing Vitamin D to your body, it will help to set your circadian rhythm that in turn control the release of cortisol in your body. Current researches show that high cortisol levels decrease our body’s ability to convert T4 to T3, and also due to <strong>delayed sleep cycle melatonin influences the release of Thyroid stimulating hormone</strong>. Thereby, we start having impact on Thyroid, weight, and our thought process.</p>
<p>Now talking about our major concern that how <strong>thoughts impact our Thyroid gland</strong>. Think of a thing or a scene deeply and you will certainly start having an appropriate hormone release. For example if we watch an action movie or a comedy movie, hormone released will be different; if we think of a thick forest with snakes, a different hormone will be released; if we visualise mountains with river and cool breeze blowing then certainly a special health improving hormone can be released. Now, we need to understand that the Thyroid gland is the gland that will get signals to produce appropriate hormone which could be a hormone that improves our health or a hormone that depletes our health. I think by now we are on the same page that <strong>everything depends on the type of thoughts we think of. </strong></p>
<p>Therefore, when we wish something and keep our Thyroid gland under pressure and keep of thinking that continuously will start having a negative impact on the gland. Therefore, wishing something materialistic for our better future is good, however, pressure on our gland to be perfect and our goal to achieve should be taken care of in a balanced manner, and in place of keeping our gland under pressure we should keep happy and consider it as a game and accept the consequences happily. That attitude is also termed as being <strong>“happy going lucky” or we also call it as “Divine’s plan” for us</strong>. Furthermore, we should <strong>stop “negative self-talking” </strong>to stop impacting our Thyroid gland to produce stress hormones. In addition to this, <strong>ANGER is </strong>our biggest enemy and it would be acting like a biggest size of boulder on all our glands.</p>
<p>It’s an irony in today’s world that first in search of perfection we deliberately disturb our hormonal balance, and then that hormonal dysfunction starts disturbing us. Even then if we open our eyes, we can stop short of this above mentioned collateral damage. By saying being aware, I mean that we should start understanding human life and nature. Few things that could help us are: Breathing exercises, Mudra practice, Yoga and meditation, observing nature, and following the Sun and regulating our sleep cycle accordingly, no negative talking or thinking, and controlling anger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naturally recurring altered consciousness of mind and body is known as sleeping. Dozing is composed of a series cycles of 90-minute during which brain moves from deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep to REM sleep. This cycle is generally stable throughout the night. However, ratio of non-REM to REM sleep changes. Head of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Matt Walker explains that “non-REM sleep tends to dominate slumber cycles in the early part of the night. But as clock creeps toward daybreak, REM sleep muscles in.” That can be considered significant, because as per some researches non-REM sleep is deeper and more restorative than lighter, dream-infused REM sleep, however, both offer important benefits.<span id="more-1842"></span></p>
<p>We have window of several hours between 8 pm till 12 am, during this our brain has the chance to get all REM and non-REM cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect bedtime:</strong><br />
Dr. Matt Walker further explains that the regardless of when one goes to bed, shift from non-REM to REM sleep happens at certain times of the night. Therefore if someone hit the bed very late, for example 3 AM-sleep will certainly tilt toward REM-heavy sleep. Reduction in deep, restorative sleep may leave you groggy, tired, and blunt-minded the next day. Negative thoughts easily enter a tired and groggy mind.</p>
<p>One study shows, people had lower scores on standardized tests of memory and processing speed had an experience working at night. People who had a decade or more of shift work or going to sleep late in the night experience had such pronounced cognitive deficits that were equivalent to about 6.5 years of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>It’s not a good idea that to learn to work at night and sleep during the day. Body’s circadian rhythms that regulate everything from sleeping patterns to energy levels through thyroid hormone, digestion, movement of bowels, and hunger levels tells brain the time to go to sleep as per day pattern. It’s considered to be not natural to reset or reschedule circadian rhythms when it comes to bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>Duration of sleep:</strong><br />
As per National Sleep Foundation recommendation adults should get the following amount of sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults — 7.5 to 9 hours daily.</li>
<li>Older Adults 65+ — 7 to 8 hours daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortened sleep has many effects, people who slept for five hours a night for just a week<br />
had a higher heart rate during the day as per one of the recent study.</p>
<p>As per study from Paul Kelley and Oxford University, ideal wakeup time when we are in our<br />
20s is 9:30 a.m.; in our 30s is 8 a.m.; in our 40s is 7:30 a.m.; in our 50s is 7 a.m.; and in 60s 6:30 a.m.</p>
<p>As per one of the traditional medicines, from 11pm to 3am most of your blood circulation<br />
concentrates in your liver that helps in detoxification process. Liver then neutralizes and breaks<br />
down body toxins accumulated throughout the day. Therefore sleeping at this for the smooth<br />
process to be carried becomes very important. It is believed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to sleep at 11pm, have full 4 hours to detoxify your body.</li>
<li>Going to sleep at 12am, you have 3 hours.</li>
<li>Going to sleep at 1am, you have 2 hours.</li>
<li>And going to sleep at 2am, you only have 1 hour to detoxify.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been researched that sleeping late and/or less than 7.5 hours of sleep daily can lead to chronic<br />
health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, impaired brain activity, depression, memory<br />
problems, cognitive dysfunction, weight gain, impact on child bearing, hallucinations, thyroid<br />
disorder, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Dr. Matt Walker says that it is very paramount for everyone specifically students, child<br />
bearing females, and 60+ aged adults to understand the ideal sleep time and duration for living a<br />
healthy and prosperous life, he further adds that people suffering from different medical condition<br />
ranging from fever, pregnancy, endocrinal disorder specially the thyroid disorder, and cardio<br />
disorder etc. to heed to the advice and take care of their sleeping time and duration to avoid any<br />
further deterioration and recover quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Ayurveda is world’s oldest healing science that was devised by lord Dhanvantari and has been used for thousands of years by rishis and doctors.  It has proved to be very useful system of prevention and healing and attaining wellness.  In this system importance of physical and mental balance, emotional release, spiritual growth and environmental mindfulness has been recognised.  Ayurvedic system has been promulgated by lord Dhanvantari.  As per BhagwataPurana, Dhanvantari emerged from Ocean of Milk along with pot of elixir for immortality during SagarManthan.<span id="more-1748"></span></p>
<p>Ayurveda can be used by all people in all climates.  Ayurveda uses natural forces like herbs, diet, heat, cold, minerals, exercise, oils, and meditation to help attain wellness from illness.  It is believed in Ayurveda that health results from harmony within one’s self; that is to say your health depends on your thoughts, feelings, trust on others, and satisfaction.  This harmony further manifests externally as harmony with family, friends, co-workers, juniors, society, and nature.  In case a human is not in harmony within one’s self it would manifest the same with others before showing the signs and symptoms of disease.  Ayurveda being an optimistic science considers the manifestation of symptoms and disease as positive development since it is considered as a call to change for a positive attitude and gives a person a chance to either change from inside or go in for an overhaul, however, for this to happen a person has to dedicatedly work on mind to generate positive thoughts internally that would be manifested as healthy body and healthy relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example an individual “A” who remains quiet, keeps on smiling and might not do things with absolute perfection might be just due to he is in peace within himself, however, he might be considered as mysterious and imperfect personality in today’s modern world.  In contrast to this there might be a personality “B” who might be energetic, does everything with perfection would be appreciated for work by outer world, however, from inside this type of personality might not be in peace with self.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ayurvedic therapy system considers human to be made up of five elements and considers to be miniature of universe, that is to say that the vastness of universe lies within humans.  Five elements are Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Ether.  Now these five elements combine in pairs to form three doshas or life forces.  The dynamism of this makes life happen.  Ether and Air makes up Vata.  Fire and water makes up Pitta.  Water and earth makes up Kapha.  These three forces keep on changing dynamically to make life happen.  These forces are influenced by the thoughts, environment, diet, lifestyle, and time of the day.  When all these factors are in sync with nature and in line with betterment of living being produces beautiful impacts.  The Ayurvedic therapies have been designed to balance out these forces, however, before applying any of the therapy a complete consultation is required since every body type is unique and a Doctor or Vedacharya can only decide the appropriate therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To conclude, we can say that Ayurveda being one of the finest medical sciences teaches us that everything is within us, and by taking a positive outlook and ignoring the negative happenings, we should be able to get the best results out of us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Make peace with ourselves, energise our bodies, positively stimulate our mind, and calm our soul.”-Gaurav Malik</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>“Healthy Smile Leads to a Healthy Life”</strong></p>
<p>The attractiveness of a face is a highly salient social signal in professional workplace, influencing mate choice, and other social judgements. People express a range of emotions with the structure and movement of the teeth and lips called smile, can often determine how well a person can function in society. Smile has been considered as a most important feature of an attractive face. A beautiful smile sends positive stimuli to its recipients. An ancient Chinese proverb says “A man without a smiling face must not open shop”.</p>
<p>A warm smile can make you appear much more approachable and friendly. Even the earliest civilizations; both the Phoenicians and Etruscians carefully carved animal tusks to simulate the shape, form and hue of natural teeth. Keeping teeth, gums, lips, and jaw healthy are precursors to a beautiful smile. Cosmetic dentistry is more popular nowadays than ever. In cosmetic dentistry designing a beautiful smile is one of the major components along with other procedures. Healthy and beautiful smile depends on many major and minor factors, these can be analyzed at dental clinics/offices.</p>
<p>Designing smiles starts from cleaning, whitening, straightening and contouring of teeth, teeth reshaping. In advanced cases it also includes closing spaces, covering the front aspect of tooth, improving irregular bite, jaw positioning, correcting jaw joint disorders, designing gum lines, placing of bone grafts, reshaping and contouring gum and lip’s surfaces, and replacing teeth. Dental surgeons have a wide array of tools and techniques at their disposal for improving the look of your smile.</p>
<p>Beautiful smile is ensured by proper oral care and that in turn has shown to be an essential habit for diabetics, and bacteria in the mouth have been linked to colorectal cancer, cardiac disease, and other forms of chronic disease. It’s no secret that your mouth is a gateway to your body, and keeping a clean and healthy mouth is important for many other health reasons. Before undertaking any cosmetic procedure, a proper pathway is charted out to make your smile a beautiful one.</p>
<p>Simple steps to achieve a beautiful smile:<br />
 Start smiling: It takes almost three times as many muscles to frown as it does to smile.<br />
 More often eat foods that are smile friendly –Eat less of foods that discolour oral structures or bring ulcers.<br />
 Brush at least twice a day in a proper manner, and use floss if possible.<br />
 Try to smell your breath, it’s a good indicator of your oral health. In case required get the things rectified.<br />
 Say a big no to smoking cigarettes, chewing tobacco, drinking alcohol, and also to substances that alters your good state of mind.<br />
 Stop being self-conscious about your smile.<br />
 Be optimistic and stop over analyzing others, and real smile will follow.<br />
 Learn to overcome the stress: Get connected with nature, listen mind friendly music, start exercising, or indulge in yoga and meditation.<br />
 Sleep well: An adult should sleep at least between 7-8 hours daily to keep his/her mental and physical condition at an optimum level.<br />
 Visit your dentist at least twice a year.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Sleep can be said as a naturally recurring state that is characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles. Sleep is a decreased ability to react to stimuli compared to wakefulness, and it is more easily reversible than being in hibernation or a coma.<span id="more-1614"></span><br />
As per researches carried on by Harvard, sleep has many physiological impacts. It may impact blood pressure, disease susceptibility, memory, learning, behaviour, immunity, mental health, sexual health, safety, and longevity.<br />
There can be difference between a sound night of sleep and a fitful night that leaves you tired the next day.<br />
As per Sleep foundation adults need 7-9 hours of sleep daily.<br />
Powerful tools to help you sleep better:<br />
<strong>A. Sleeping environment:</strong><br />
1. Temperature: Sleep scientists at sleep foundation and Harvard recommend keeping your room slightly cool. Turning the thermostat down at night in cold weather. Blankets, comforters or electric blankets can lock in heat without feeling too heavy or confining. For physically active people cool rooms help you sleep better. Looking at the available research with sleep foundation temperatures above 24 degrees centigrade and below 12 degrees centigrade can be disruptive to deep sleep.<br />
2. Noise: As per sleep foundation, noises at levels as low as 40 decibels or as high as 70 decibels can keep us awake. Absence or presence of a familiar noise can have as great an impact on your sleep as out-of-the-ordinary noises. Try to block out unwanted sounds with earplugs or use &#8220;white noise&#8221; such as a fan, air cleaner or sound conditioner. Take your favorite clock along. Remove TV and computers from your bedroom.<br />
3. Light: Researches by sleep scientists have shown much of our sleep patterns are regulated by light and darkness. Bright outdoor light is the most powerful regulator of our biological clock. Make sure to expose yourself to enough bright light during the day. Find time for sunlight, or purchase a lightbox or light visor to supplement your exposure to bright light. At bedtime, bedroom should be dark: because light disturbs your sleep and a dark bedroom contributes to better sleep. Try light blocking curtains, shades or blinds. Avoid bright light in the evening and expose yourself to sunlight in the morning.<br />
4. Sleeping Surface: As per sleep foundation, people sleep better when horizontal and not cramped by space, and it is clear that the sleep surface plays a role in getting a good night&#8217;s sleep. Give yourself enough space to sleep. If you share a bed with a partner, make sure it is large enough to give both of you room to move around. Replace an old mattress with a new one, and choose a pillow and mattress that fits you best. Change your pillows regularly. Use your bed only for sleep and sex to strengthen the association between bed and sleep.<br />
5. Ventilate your room daily-Regulate air in your room.<br />
6. Use different aromas, nice coloured and simple bedsheets, and flowers in your room. Create a soothing environment in your room.<br />
B. Stick to the same bedtime and wake up time, even on the weekends- Helps to regulate your body&#8217;s clock.<br />
C. Practice a relaxing bedtime ritual- Meditate, read a book, listen to music, or get romantic with your spouse. Keep your mobile on flight mode. If you associate a particular activity or item with anxiety about sleeping, omit it from your bedtime routine.<br />
D. Avoid naps, especially in the afternoon.<br />
E. Exercise daily.<br />
F. Avoid alcohol, cigarettes, and heavy meals in the evening.<br />
G. In case required do something relaxing until you feel tired.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you are pregnant you are prone to various problems like loosened ligaments, added weight, frequent urinations, leg cramps and new proportions. Pregnant ladies after 3rd month of pregnancy should exercise in order to avoid above mentioned constraints. Safe and scientific exercise program makes pregnancy a pleasurable event, at the same time provides immense health related benefits.</p>
<p>Below mentioned are certain exercise that are helpful and should be carried out during pregnancy strictly under your PHYSIOTHERAPIST specialized in Women’s Health and GYNECOLOGIST observation and consent.</p>
<p><strong>POSTURE CORRECTION</strong> – A good posture is highly important for better health and decreasing the chances of injury. While in standing, feet should be slightly apart, knee straight, hands by the side of trunk or behind.  In sitting, feet should touch ground, little apart or on a foot stool. Left side lying is the position of choice for high risk patient as it reduces pressure on inferior vena cava and enhances maternal and fetal circulation.</p>
<p><strong>LEG CRAMPS</strong> – Stretch your leg out and then gently flex your toes. It may take a while before it subsides. Do not overstretch. Hot water bottle can be used on the affected area. Get somebody to massage your calf vigorously.</p>
<p><strong>RELAXATION</strong> – Simply lie down, close your eyes and breathe naturally.  One should start by clenching fists tightly and followed by tensing her arms. As you breathe out, release the tension in your arms all the way down to fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>KEGEL EXERCISES</strong> – For strengthening of pelvic floor muscles and preventing pelvic floor dysfunction like prolapse or urinary incontinence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your bladder is empty before starting this exercise.</li>
<li>Start in supine lying / side lying.</li>
<li>Tighten the pelvic floor muscle as attempting to stop urine flow.</li>
<li>Concentrate on the muscles around urethra and vagina, in order to squeeze the right muscle.</li>
<li>Initially start with simple contraction and relaxation of muscle without hold and gradually start holding for 4 seconds, 10 times. Continue this exercise post-delivery also as this aids in healing of stitches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember “Talk Test” – You should be able to maintain a conversation while exercising. Drink plenty of fluids before and after exercise.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine employing a wide array of “natural” modalities, including homeopathy, herbalism, and acupuncture, as well as diet and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic practice is based on a belief in the body’s ability to heal itself through a special vital energy or force guiding bodily processes internally. Diagnosis and treatment concern primarily alternative therapies and “natural” methods. The term “naturopathy” was created from “natura and “pathos” to suggest “natural healing”. Naturopathic medicine incorporates many therapeutic modalities: herbal medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, hydrotherapy, food,Yoga, exercise therapy, physical therapy, manipulation of the bony and soft tissues, lifestyle and counseling. At a time when modern technology, environmental pollution, poor diet, and stress play a significant role in the degradation of health, a Naturopath’s ability to apply natural methods of healing is of considerable importance. Frequently, a Naturopath is the last resort in a patient’s long search for health. Providing personalized care to each patient, the naturopath sees humankind as a holistic unity of body, mind, and spirit.</p>
