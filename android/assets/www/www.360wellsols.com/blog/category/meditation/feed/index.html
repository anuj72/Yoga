Meditation again is practiced by different religions in different manner. Different types of meditations are practiced like Kundalini meditation, Zen meditation, transcendental meditation, breath meditation, visualisation, white light meditation, sound meditation, and mantra meditation.<br />
• Concentrative –Transcendental meditation<br />
• Open awareness – Zen meditation<br />
• Mindfulness – A combination of the above two, it is also called insight meditation. The practitioner focuses on an object (e.g. breath) or on bodily sensations, thoughts, feelings, or sounds. Mindful meditation extends to daily activities like3 walking, dining, doing household chores, etc.<br />
Learning and practicing meditation in Himalayas is an experience that remains carved in our minds. Experience it yourself!</p>

<p>Meditation if done with dedication can do wonders.  Few of the general condition that meditation can help are healing, pain, blood pressure, fibromyalgias, anxiety, depression, insomnia, anger, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and smoking.</p>
<p>Large amount of money is being spent in U.S. by many patients and government, to treat back pain much of that includes opioid drugs that can contribute to addiction, however, researches now show that results from opioid medication on long term basis were not as good as results with mindful meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Group Health Research Institute’s</strong> new research proves that quieting and focusing the mind is one way to help decrease chronic low back pain, and when pain starts decreasing, it in turn helps in avoiding habit-forming opioid-based dangerous painkillers.</p>
<p>As reported in Washington post, one of the first scientists to test the benefits of meditation and mindfulness in brain scans was <strong>Sara Lazar, a neuroscientist</strong> at <strong>Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  </strong>She herself started Yoga as a form of physical therapy for her running injury, very soon she started feeling better along with calmness and was able to handle more difficult situation.  Then she did a literature study and found meditation being associated with decreased stress, depression, anxiety, pain, and insomnia.  It also helps in providing cool mind and warm hearts and thereby increase quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her findings were the following: as reported in:  (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2015/05/26/harvard-neuroscientist-meditation-not-only-reduces-stress-it-literally-changes-your-brain)</p>
<p>Differences in brain volume was seen in people involved in meditation after 8 weeks of regular daily meditation for 40 minutes.  Thickening was found in the following 4 regions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Posterior cingulate was found with primary difference, that is involved in mind wandering, and self-relevance.</li>
<li>Left hippocampus assists in learning, cognition, memory and emotional regulation.</li>
<li>The temporo-parietal junction is associated with perspective taking, empathy and compassion.</li>
<li>Pons an area of the brain stem, where a lot of regulatory neurotransmitters are produced.</li>
</ol>
<p>The amygdala, the fight or flight part of the brain which is important for anxiety, fear and stress in general. That area got smaller in the group that went through the mindfulness-based stress reduction program.</p>
<p>The change in the amygdala was also correlated to a reduction in stress levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She further suggests average recommended time for getting benefits from mindful meditation is 27 minutes per day, so it can be taken as approximately 30 minutes a day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been many researches performed on this topic which shows that regardless of religious affiliation, diseases or health conditions, age, sex, race or ethnicity, or nationality there is a clear positive relationships existing between religious and spiritual practice and health outcomes on a variety of different conditions.</p>
<p>Few of the studies 180 approximately have been done and few are being performed as a part of distant healing research.  More than half of the studies on distant healing have produced significant results.  In these studies/experiments, an individual/healer through their meditation visualise and tries to influence the physical condition, disease, or physiology of a target system, such as cell cultures, bones, and other bodily systems.  As of March 2004, there have been nine controlled clinical trials looking at intercessory prayer (compassionate intention at a distance).  Six of these have produced statistically significant positive results.</p>
<p>We can go through the Institute of Noetic Sciences’ Web site (<a href="http://www.previewmywebsitenow.com/app/browse.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noetic.org%2F&amp;b=4">www.noetic.org</a>) for a detailed description and list of these studies.</p>
<p>To conclude, in addition to other doing a distant for someone if the person themselves start meditating it would work at an exponential level.  Therefore, I would recommend everyone should take up the practice of meditation and start moving towards overall wellness.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meditation is training of mind or inducing mode of consciousness that helps to know yourself in a better.  It calms down the mind quickly thereby turning it into a stable and relaxed mind that in turn helps in controlling high blood pressure, depression, anxiety, and many other health disorders.  All five senses are governed by mind and in turn they relay a message to mind.  These five senses can be instrumental in achieving a level of meditation.</p>
<p>Here, we will discuss how hearing one of the five senses can be helpful in this.  As ancient and modern researches music can help mind in relaxing by signalling to release hormones that induce relaxation and healing.  Few of the music have nodes that can induce adrenaline rush, whereas few helps in reaching stable and meditative level.</p>
<p>To activate chakras “ragas” have been used while meditating, it activates the chakra and allows “Kundalini energy” to rise and nourish or recharge that chakra and then move upwards. This helps in removing doshas and obstructions that chakra and related body part or organ might be having.</p>
<p>Sahajayoga (<a href="http://www.previewmywebsitenow.com/app/browse.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sahajayoga.org&amp;b=4">http://www.sahajayoga.org</a>) a meditation technique by HH Mataji Shri Nirmala devi explains these ragas in detail which is as following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shyam Kalyan raga</strong> is associated with Mooladhara chakra. It helps in establishing chastity, wisdom, and child like innocence. This raga helps in establishing “Earth element” in the practitioner’s body, that means a stability due to gravity of earth is developed.</li>
<li><strong>Raga Gurjari Todi</strong> has a capacity to cool down the Liver. This raga and the raga Yaman help activate the our attention governing Swadishthan chakra. Both ragas help to decrease wavering attention, which is crucial for effective meditation.  Quality of the Fire Element is developed by this and makes our personality creative, balanced, closely attentive and spiritual.</li>
<li>The <strong>raga Abhogi</strong> helps activate the Nabhi chakra and stimulate the digestion process. When the Kundalini enters this Chakra and cleanse it, this brings inner transformation by change of attitudes. This raga is also known to bring about de-addiction in human beings it helps one give up immoral or shouting behaviour and impulsive or compulsive habits.  This raga helps develop the quality of the water element.</li>
<li>The<strong> ragas Durga and Bhairav </strong>have a power of Divine bliss and protection. Both help in activating the Anahat chakra.  On touching the heart chakra by kundalini, raga Bhairav activates spirituality in the person.  Self-confidence and quality of the air element is developed.  These ragas also enhance the Divinity and Immunity in children.</li>
<li>The <strong>raga Jayjaywanti</strong> helps activate the Vishuddhi chakra, the controller of the sensory organs. Quality of the ether element and the expression of voice is developed by this raga, and it further helps make one’s personality loving and sweet.</li>
<li>The <strong>raga Bhup</strong> is instrumental in purifying and opening the Agnya chakra. Tensions, anger and mental fatigue are relieved by it.  Passing of Kundalini through the Agnya chakra and entering the chakra called Sahasrara in the limbic area of the brain is enabled by creation of mood by this raga. This causes the person to reach a state of thoughtless awareness and has a tremendous impact on our ability to forgive.</li>
<li><strong>Ragas Darbari and Bhairavi</strong> are helpful in prolonging the state of meditation and thoughtless awareness. The notes of these ragas help relax and calm the emotionally-related limbic area. The Kundalini energy then proceeds further to soothe and nourishes the Sahasrara chakra and the brain. This the state where individual feels, joyous, energetic, peaceful and relieved of stress, tension and depression. The person also enjoys the sensation of a cool breeze on the finger tips and achieves the state of Self-Realization or enlightenment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuous practice of meditation with music can help in achieving the benefits of true meditation easily by making a person transform into a stable and loving personality, with an increased understanding and responsibility towards other living beings.  So, to start with sit in a comfortable place and position with an access to audio device.  Focus on your breathes for 5 minutes and then</p>
