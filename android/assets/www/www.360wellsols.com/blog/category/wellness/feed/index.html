				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shabbat is the Jewish day of rest having its origins in the Torah – Law of God. It is based on the premise that God worked six days at creating the world and on the seventh day he ceased working, blessed the day and declared it holy.<br />
Shabbat is primarily a day of rest and spiritual enrichment. The word Shabbat comes from the root Shin-Bet-Tav, meaning to cease, to end, or to rest. In a general meaning, Shabbat frees a person from his/her weekday concerns, from deadlines, schedules, and commitments.<br />
We at 360° Wellness Solutions closely embody the spirit of Shabbat, and as a provider of well-being, we help our guests in exploring each aspect of well-being – physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.<br />
Well-being activities like yoga, meditation, silent walking, and more, work on the premise that they help in creating an inner spiritual connect with one’s own self and promote time for one’s own self.<br />
For our guests from Israel, we propose to have the following services available soon**:<br />
· No non-Shabbat food in the room of the guest.</p>
<p>· No phone calls to the guest room post afternoon</p>
<p>· No wellness treatments from afternoon (Friday) till next day afternoon (Saturday)</p>
<p>· Provision of Special bread (Challah).</p>
<p>· Provision for Scaled fish stew (Cholent)</p>
<p>· Food to be prepared before sunset and placed in hot plates – food not to be removed from the hot plates or reheated; hot food is served hot and cold food cold.</p>
<p>· Dinner to be served in the room of the guest.</p>
<p>· After sunrise guest can come out of the room and eat breakfast – again hot food is served hot and cold food cold.</p>
<p>** Though we are not an organization which promotes any religion in general, our philosophy is to be inspired by the spiritual and wellbeing principles which are universal and followed by the different religions of the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colour therapy is as old as any other medicine in oldest civilizations and has been used in India, Egypt, Greece, and China. It is believed to have been investigated as medicine since 2000 BC. In that age society might have been unaware of colour’s effect as a medicine, but surely had faith in healing with colours. Primary colours red, blue and yellow were used for healing. The science seems to have been silent at those times.</p>
<p>It is believed that body’s seven chakras are related to the seven colours of the rainbow. Therefore, it is believed that if harmony of colours is disturbed in the body it leads to disorders in the body, and after getting diagnosed by a colour therapist that particular disorder can be treated by appropriate spectrum of colours. Here light moves in waves of varying lengths and, as each colour has a different wavelength and a particular spectrum is focussed on. This is done in a specially designed rooms by throwing that of colours on walls, by shoning up light on skin, treating water in glass bottles with colours, or may be through small torches.</p>
<p>Evidence of colour therapy has been seen on mood and general well being. Robert Gerard in 1958 conducted a study that showed the power of stimulation by red and makes anxious and affected appetite, blood pressure, and aggression; while blue promoted calmness.</p>
<p>Ghadiali research stated “The colour bands of spectrograms are produced when a chemical element undergoes a process of combustion or vaporization that accelerates the motion of its atoms. The specific band of colours and dark lines emitted when a certain element is heated, are known as Fraunhauafer.” He also found that “by treating the body with a particular colour vibration, one could effectively reintroduce the appropriate biochemical elements into the body; he referred to this as colour chemistry, certainly a new field of study. His results as published in the first decade of the twentieth century were advocated by Klotsche (1) in Colour Medicine: colour medicine not only can heal the diseased frequency of the body but also can introduce actual chemical elements/vibration into the body in a non-toxic form.”</p>
<p>Journal published by Samina T. Yousuf Azeemi and S. Mohsin Raza states “Chromotherapy as a system of treatment can benefit people because of its harmony with nature. Everything that exists in this world is a combination of different colours”</p>
<p>Consultant psychologist Ingrid Collins states “We know that the cells of the human body are constructed from atoms and that each atom consists of particles of energy in constant motion. We are therefore at the most fundamental level made of energy and information, so when we add a particular colour we are adding energy into our lives.”</p>
<p>It is being used in Texas, there inmates are dressed in pink to reduce aggression. It is being widely used for treating insomnia, stress, immune deficiency problems, and also for critical illness. People who have been through this therapy states that after the therapy there is a feeling freshness and many have been helped in case of insomnia.</p>
<p>Explore colours deeply and get rejuvenated!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Consciousness</h2>
<p>Human consciousness can be compared with flowing water, as the temperature goes does down it contracts water into ice that is a solid state, and as when temperature rises it becomes liquid state.<span id="more-1891"></span></p>
<p>When water in a river is in liquid state it usually flows, can adjust itself in any space, remain independent but still united with other droplets,splash together, and even flow in one direction making its way within the harsh terrain like mountains.  However, the same water on decreasing temperature turns it into ice which in turn gets segregated into different blocks that usually stays in a same place and hits against other blocks of ice.  Water gushes into other water bodies and merges itself smoothly into other water bodies, whereas, ice hits other ice blocks and leads to collateral damage.</p>
<p>This can be compared with expanding consciousness and contractive consciousness.  As the conscious energy gets low and our consciousness contracts and become similar to ice, we as humans tend to divide ourselves; start being selfish;ignore divine and nature; build higher egos; misunderstand others; pretend to be superior to others;blame others; hurt others; and tend to get hurt easily.</p>
<p>However, as this ice melts and there is high flow of energy that expands our consciousness, we start realising the world as the divine has designed it;appreciate every activity and plans of divine and nature; feel the flow of divine love within our warm hearts towards others; expand our vision; start adjusting in different situations;smile, forgive and forget very easily; wherever we go people feel more comfortable and are attracted towards us just like iron gets attracted to a magnet;we avoid hurting others and never get hurt.  This enables a person to live a “happy go lucky” lifestyle.</p>
<p>Consciousness creates reality and affects our outer world, expanding our consciousness will be certainly helpful for our families, societies, and countries.  When we merge and cooperate with each other at the level of countries, communities, or families;our vision would expand and we will flow smoothly that would enable us to progress exponentially by getting more opportunities and cracking them with synergised energies.  This is the time that we all should take a lead within ourselves in thinking and acting actively in increasing the lowered energy levels to expand our consciousness.  Different approaches like meditation; yoga; exercise; social interaction; and understanding and appreciating different sects of communities should be opted together in a Sahaja (easy) manner.This would ensue warmth in relationships of countries, communities, and families.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Earth was nascent, there were kingdoms of health and prosperity.  The people of that kingdom were connected to each other and to the nature.  Every element had its importance and was taken care while constructing buildings.Every county/villages, subsections, buildings had separate places for art and culture, playing, studying, relaxing, social interactions, sleeping, toilets, exercising, and storage etc.The arts flourished, creativity used to be at its peak with less distractions, time was spent dedicatedly to an activity. Each adult in the kingdom used to practice a profession that used to give them satisfaction and joy, and also supported their kingdom. <span id="more-1607"></span></p>
<p>Following the Sun was the motive of such kingdoms. Each building was designed in a manner such that they helped humans in maintaining a healthy life by following the God’s design of circadian rhythm. Work, enjoyment, and rest were balanced. People used to work in night only for security and emergencies and that too on a rotatory basis and were recommended to rest few days before merging back into regular life.</p>
<p>The forests, natural resources were taken care of and were revered like gods. Buildings were made without destroying forests and natural resources. Material for constructing such buildings was taken locally and excess was again returned to the nature. Each building were designed in such a way that they used air and Sun’s rays to heat, cool, and sanitise each room naturally as per the weather. Comfort level of humans was maintained naturally as per the requirement of that particular room. Human waste was collected by each family and was taken back to specialised zone where it was decomposed and used as manure in forests and farms. Each family knew their responsibility towards maintain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ecosystem of forests and water were undisturbed by activities of humans in the kingdom. No wastage from human activities was poured into the water that helped water to so clean that the water did not require any purification and used for drinking directly. Herbs and other materials taken from forests were taken in such a manner that there was plenty of every species were left to flourish.<br />
Everyone cared for children of the kingdom. Children were taught about earth and the place and responsibilities humans had in it. Learning was done in a manner that it had enjoyment equivalent to playing. There studies had a more holistic approach that involved knowing themselves and God’s gifted nature, meditating, performing exercises, studying, gardening, playing physical games, and pursuing their hobbies by getting involved in arts and culture activities. Children were motivated with positive display of art and sculpture in whole kingdom, in their houses, and their schools. They were also taught to understand and appreciate others. They were motivated to be connected with nature.</p>
<p>Healers of the kingdom use to treat and preach the people. Their motive was to maintain the wellness of society so that it does not proceed towards sickness. They used meditation, yoga, diet, counselling, physical activities, aromas, and herbs as tolls of wellness. Teachers and healers had a main role in maintaining wellness of the kingdom.<br />
King used to take advice from scholars, teachers, and healers for making policies that would<br />
increase the happiness in kingdom. Every second of time was full of joy and enjoyed by almost<br />
everyone.</p>
<p>May God restore such a kingdom that was full of “Wellness”.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color of Clothes and our personality by Dr. RM Mehra</p>
<p>Whatever color we pick up to wear, in some way or other is indicative of our personality. <strong>Clothes color and personality type</strong> are two terms that tell a lot about each other. Clothes and color styling says a lot about your individuality. It is interesting to know about the philosophy of colors. You must have noticed reserved people often choose to attire in sober shades, which do not flash their personality. On the contrary bold men can be often seen wearing dark bright shades that highlight their presence in the crowd.</p>
<p>Here are some generalizations about colors that will show <strong>how color of clothes affects personality</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is symbolic of dominance, passion and sensuality. It is a color meant for bold and firm men who love to lead the world. If you want to make a distinctive statement, red is the trick.</li>
<li><strong>Peach and pink</strong> shades are indicative of coolness and calm. With pink, you’ll look as fresh as a flower.</li>
<li><strong>Black</strong>, an all time favorite represents power. Acting as a symbol of elegance, versatility and grace, this color can smoothly sail in all functions.</li>
<li>If your focus is on looking neat and clean, <strong>white</strong> is just apt for you. It indicates purity and simplicity. It is the perfect summer color.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> is a color of warmth and trust. It’s a fabulous shade that can be found in almost every man’s cupboard.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> is the color of beautiful sunflower. It conveys anxiety of mind. But do not forget it is also the color of deadly fire.</li>
<li><strong>Burgundy</strong> is indicative of spirituality. It is a rich color that decides how passionate you are. Burgundy shirt looks stylish.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> comes from greenery. It is a color of nature with beautiful green leaves, fresh green vegetables. It represents freshness, relaxation and calm.</li>
<li><strong>Brown</strong> is meant for classy informal styling. It conveys reliability and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Gray</strong> is indicative of the fact that you are a balanced person in life. It looks elegant and is considered to be brainy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, decide for yourself as in which type are you judging your personality traits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naturopathy or naturopathic medicine is a form of alternative medicine employing a wide array of “natural” modalities, including homeopathy, herbalism, and acupuncture, as well as diet and lifestyle counseling. Naturopathic practice is based on a belief in the body’s ability to heal itself through a special vital energy or force guiding bodily processes internally. Diagnosis and treatment concern primarily alternative therapies and “natural” methods. The term “naturopathy” was created from “natura and “pathos” to suggest “natural healing”. Naturopathic medicine incorporates many therapeutic modalities: herbal medicine, homeopathy, nutrition, hydrotherapy, food,Yoga, exercise therapy, physical therapy, manipulation of the bony and soft tissues, lifestyle and counseling. At a time when modern technology, environmental pollution, poor diet, and stress play a significant role in the degradation of health, a Naturopath’s ability to apply natural methods of healing is of considerable importance. Frequently, a Naturopath is the last resort in a patient’s long search for health. Providing personalized care to each patient, the naturopath sees humankind as a holistic unity of body, mind, and spirit.</p>

Starting from waking up individuals are seen playing music while getting ready, cooking, while commuting or while in office, and while exercising to keep them energised to work.<span id="more-1639"></span> Music and mood have been interlinked, different music can lead to different reactions. Some of them might generate adrenaline rush, some, may make us happy or sad, whereas few can calm us down and help us in relaxing. A clear example which all of us have experienced is when we listen to some rock music, we get energised and excited, however, when this adrenaline rush goes down to normal level we get a feeling of tiredness, therefore it shows our body under the influence of music has worked extra mile that has led to tiredness.</p>
<p>As per Indian philosophy, ragas or classical music is used to remove blockages of internal vibrations at different levels or chakras. Ragas are believed to impact different parts of brain thereby generating wanted results at different levels in our body, a complete research has been done by scholars on this subject. Ragas are sometimes used with imageries to produce altered or meditative state of consciousness that can stimulate the positive response and enhancing healing. The five internal organ and meridian systems are believed to have corresponding musical tones in Chinese medicine, which are used to encourage healing.</p>
<p>Research by Uma Gupta and B.S. Gupta in 2005 on psychophysiological responsivity to Indian instrumental music clearly shows that “instrumental music led to a significant increase in the alpha EEG frequency and a significant decrease in the scores on depression, state and trait anxiety, and the four components of anxiety”. It has also been studied for numerous medical conditions. (http://www.naturalstandard.com/databases/hw/all/patient-musictherapy.asp). Different types of music are being used by people world over to cure insomnia and depression.</p>
<p>Indian classical music has been amongst the most ancient therapeutic music league and after a thorough research is being used for different conditions, meditation and cure. We all need to understand the impact of music in more detail and use it for the betterment of mankind.<br />
Travel through power of Indian classical music and rediscover yourself!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homeopathy, which originated as a healing art and science in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century from Germany works on the law of similars, which basically means that the remedy which would be selected for one’s specific concern(s) would also have the ability to produce the same set of concerns when given to a healthy individual.</p>
<p>The wellness approach through Homeopathy would be holistic and constitutional, focussing on the person/individual and selecting the most appropriate remedy (-ies) based on the symptom picture, that would be analysed.</p>
<p><strong>How a Homeopathic consultation works?</strong></p>
<p>The consultant/Homeopath does an in-depth consultation starting with getting information related to one’s current ailments and problems, their modifying (aggravating and ameliorating) conditions and would then take the client you through a set of questions to analyse and assess the physical generals and mind general symptoms, which would form the basis of the final analysis.</p>
<p>The information thus collected would help the homeopath in what is called the constitutional or miasmatic scrutiny and forms the crux of the homeopathic consultation process.</p>
<p>Miasms form the base of the constitutional make up of a person which establishes the inherent vulnerability of a person to their internal and external influences.</p>
<p>It can be transferred through generations which are known as heredity characters and the susceptibility is further moulded by ones’ environment and other external influences.</p>
<p>Miasm is the sum total of the physical and mind expressions/make up of a person. This will help to understand the group of Homeopathic remedies that we may need to begin the treatment and follow up with complementary set of remedies, if required.</p>
<p>The dosage would be highly regulated so as to avoid any kind of unwanted aggravations of the symptoms expressed by the client.  So it is imperative that these small sweet pills be taken as per recommendation which would be given to the client.</p>
<p>In one’s wellness journey, Homeopathic remedies can be used to achieve an internal detox of the vital organs like the liver, kidneys and skin.  One can experience relaxation and destress through the range of Bach Flower remedies used by the Homeopath.  Weight management Homeopathic remedies can be given internally to clients along with the external massage therapies.</p>
<p>We at 360° Wellness Solutions, believe in integrating the different healing systems so as to give our clients an experience which is unique and also seeped in the culture of our land.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vedic word comes from the scriptures called as Vedas. Indian civilization being one of the earliest civilizations had its own style of living, it was guided and governed by spiritual and cultural heritage. The motive of that lifestyle was <strong>“Loka samasta sukhinoh bhavantu”</strong> that means there may be happiness in the entire universe and that did not consider any borders created by humans. This lifestyle in turn kept people happy as they did not have a heavy baggage of bad feelings for others, food consumed was more natural and prepared in a very simple but hygienic manner, people used to exercise and work hard physically, yoga and meditation was practised on a daily basis, buildings were made in such a manner so that there used to be a lot of interaction between its occupants and nature, and love was the vital source of fuel for this lifestyle, thereby they use to live a healthy life.<br />
Are we serious when we talk about “Vedic Lifestyle” in this modern world? Is it relevant in this fast moving world?<br />
Our answer to both the prior questions is “YES”. Vedic lifestyle in simple terms means “Conscious Living”, it is completely secular and can be done by people following their own religion, their own culture, and indulging in work. Base line of following “Vedic Lifestyle” is to work in today’s world and enjoying manmade entertainment; however, practising nature guided lifestyle on a daily basis. When we indulge in manmade entertainment we stimulate our senses and enjoy for that period of time as our “Adrenaline” levels shoots up, however, after few hours when “adrenaline” goes back to the normal level and we feel extremely tired and dull because we have made our body and organs to overwork for that period of time. Same is the scenario of working conditions today that one tends to feel extremely tired, stressed, depressed, and dull after the whole day of work, though in this condition getting tired might be normal, however, getting stressed, depressed, and dull is not. These examples do not mean that we should stop these activities completely; it’s just to show that we need energy to fulfil these energy requirements. Therefore, when we start practicing “Vedic lifestyle” on a daily basis while carrying out these activities in our fast moving modern world, we might get tired, but since we will keep on getting source of energy we will work with more concentration and will be more joyous, satisfied, and feel excited even at the end of the day. We need to learn that we are a soul that is a reflection of cosmic soul.<br />
Therefore, we intend to promote revival of “Vedic Lifestyle” by carrying out public campaigns and working with NGOs working dedicatedly towards this movement.</p>
