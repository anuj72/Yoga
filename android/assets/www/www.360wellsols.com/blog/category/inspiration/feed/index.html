				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shabbat is the Jewish day of rest having its origins in the Torah – Law of God. It is based on the premise that God worked six days at creating the world and on the seventh day he ceased working, blessed the day and declared it holy.<br />
Shabbat is primarily a day of rest and spiritual enrichment. The word Shabbat comes from the root Shin-Bet-Tav, meaning to cease, to end, or to rest. In a general meaning, Shabbat frees a person from his/her weekday concerns, from deadlines, schedules, and commitments.<br />
We at 360° Wellness Solutions closely embody the spirit of Shabbat, and as a provider of well-being, we help our guests in exploring each aspect of well-being – physical, mental, emotional and spiritual.<br />
Well-being activities like yoga, meditation, silent walking, and more, work on the premise that they help in creating an inner spiritual connect with one’s own self and promote time for one’s own self.<br />
For our guests from Israel, we propose to have the following services available soon**:<br />
· No non-Shabbat food in the room of the guest.</p>
<p>· No phone calls to the guest room post afternoon</p>
<p>· No wellness treatments from afternoon (Friday) till next day afternoon (Saturday)</p>
<p>· Provision of Special bread (Challah).</p>
<p>· Provision for Scaled fish stew (Cholent)</p>
<p>· Food to be prepared before sunset and placed in hot plates – food not to be removed from the hot plates or reheated; hot food is served hot and cold food cold.</p>
<p>· Dinner to be served in the room of the guest.</p>
<p>· After sunrise guest can come out of the room and eat breakfast – again hot food is served hot and cold food cold.</p>
<p>** Though we are not an organization which promotes any religion in general, our philosophy is to be inspired by the spiritual and wellbeing principles which are universal and followed by the different religions of the world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Vigour, an attitude of forgiveness towards others, courage, purity, goodwill, towards others, and freedom from pride. All of these, dear Arjuna, are considered by Me to be the great characteristics of a man who possesses a divine nature and has come into this world from heaven.” &#8211; Gita Ch.16 Shloka 03<br />
<span id="more-1772"></span>“Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us”-Lord’s Prayer</p>
<p>In our daily lives, forgiveness is the biggest medicine that helps in achieving contentment and promotes wellness. Do we want to waste our prized life in causing discomfort to others, expecting a lot from others, hurting and getting hurt by others, and keeping our hearts heavily filled with grudges against others? Do we really have time to find fault in others? In a way by forgiving others, we let go negative thoughts thereby making our mind, heart, and body light and connect with joy.</p>
<p>The capability of forgiving others and expecting less from others shows the level of control we have on our mind and lives. Many consider forgiveness as a sign of weakness, however, in reality it is easier to retaliate whereas forgiving require lots of thoughtful practice. Individual can be hurt by a mistake of others or it might be due to misunderstanding, so if an individual forgives and moves on, the cause of anger can be rectified later on with love.</p>
<p>Not forgiving people and reacting to each action of others negatively can make our lives miserable; obviously, it would lead to different levels of anger every time, and it would create too many negative thoughts in our mind that in turn will only harm our bodily systems in long run starting from fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and heart disease. For example, if an individual has a habit of finding the negative most things in others and not understanding their action, then he or she will develop a habit of getting offended and reacting negatively to every second thing.</p>
<p>Not forgiving truly is a recipe for poor health and bitterness, since we carry bag of grudges and have the tendency to build on the most negative part of those replaying memories we tend to get angry easily the next time anyone repeats the same kind of action and this cycle keeps going on and we start thinking in a negative manner towards society. In case we know the person then we should also remind ourselves of the good deeds performed by that person towards us.</p>
<p>To promote wellness in our routine lives, whenever we think a mistake has been committed by others, we should hold our response and try to understand the reason or point of view of that person, in case the mistake was deliberate even then we should not take the offense and we should make ourselves safe and forgive others.</p>
<p>We should realise that forgiving others is for our own betterment and self-interest. Once we start seeing the benefits of forgiving by achieving mental and physical balance, we would realise that by<br />
forgiving others easily we tend to save energy, time, and health. Getting less offended and forgiving more can add a fresh level of joyful energies in our relationships.<br />
“To have a joyous life, get released from this suffocation of resentment, and start smiling and forgiving others. – Dr. Gaurav Malik</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“How people treat you is their Karma; how you react is yours.”-Wayne Dyer</p>
<p>Spiritual happiness can be attained by accepting the thought that this whole universe has been created by the divine and is perfect in a great sense. Accepting the divine creation as perfection within the imperfect appearing picture leads to trust and in turn that leads to spiritual happiness. <span id="more-1608"></span></p>
<p>We all understand that everything in this world has some appreciable perfection and some criticize imperfection; but if we try to understand that everything has been made for a specific role and is perfect in total this could help us in achieving spiritual happiness and would help us to relax physically and mentally. When we say we have to forgive everything, in other words that mean we need to look for perfection within the imperfect appearing picture.</p>
<p>For example: When we appreciate a flower like rose for its smell, we also criticize its thorns for the pain they might give to its holder. However, if we accept this as a divine perfection, we would appreciate that thorn must have been designed by God for some important role and that might be helping Roses to survive and provide good fragrance.</p>
<p>By telescoping our mind, heart, eyes towards a larger picture and accepting perfection and goodness in others, it helps us leaving unrealistic expectation that brings dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Accepting the perfection within the imperfect looking picture helps in increasing the awareness by providing more time to focus on ourselves, this helps in soothing your inner self by releasing such hormones and load you with more innocence, which further helps you in smiling with an open heart.</p>
<p>This does not mean that one should not be cautious towards the harmful action of others, in that case it’s quite obvious that an appropriate way of protection should be sought, however, making everything lean and perfect will push us away from satisfaction and spiritual happiness. Therefore, to conclude I would say that spiritual happiness and contentment is in our hands and once we become spiritually happy then we land in divine’s hands.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Color of Clothes and our personality by Dr. RM Mehra</p>
<p>Whatever color we pick up to wear, in some way or other is indicative of our personality. <strong>Clothes color and personality type</strong> are two terms that tell a lot about each other. Clothes and color styling says a lot about your individuality. It is interesting to know about the philosophy of colors. You must have noticed reserved people often choose to attire in sober shades, which do not flash their personality. On the contrary bold men can be often seen wearing dark bright shades that highlight their presence in the crowd.</p>
<p>Here are some generalizations about colors that will show <strong>how color of clothes affects personality</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Red</strong> is symbolic of dominance, passion and sensuality. It is a color meant for bold and firm men who love to lead the world. If you want to make a distinctive statement, red is the trick.</li>
<li><strong>Peach and pink</strong> shades are indicative of coolness and calm. With pink, you’ll look as fresh as a flower.</li>
<li><strong>Black</strong>, an all time favorite represents power. Acting as a symbol of elegance, versatility and grace, this color can smoothly sail in all functions.</li>
<li>If your focus is on looking neat and clean, <strong>white</strong> is just apt for you. It indicates purity and simplicity. It is the perfect summer color.</li>
<li><strong>Blue</strong> is a color of warmth and trust. It’s a fabulous shade that can be found in almost every man’s cupboard.</li>
<li><strong>Yellow</strong> is the color of beautiful sunflower. It conveys anxiety of mind. But do not forget it is also the color of deadly fire.</li>
<li><strong>Burgundy</strong> is indicative of spirituality. It is a rich color that decides how passionate you are. Burgundy shirt looks stylish.</li>
<li><strong>Green</strong> comes from greenery. It is a color of nature with beautiful green leaves, fresh green vegetables. It represents freshness, relaxation and calm.</li>
<li><strong>Brown</strong> is meant for classy informal styling. It conveys reliability and trust.</li>
<li><strong>Gray</strong> is indicative of the fact that you are a balanced person in life. It looks elegant and is considered to be brainy.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, decide for yourself as in which type are you judging your personality traits.</p>

<p><strong>Homes, &amp; Power of Sun- by Dr. RM Mehra</strong></p>
<p>Whenever we talk about VASTU, we refer to cardinal directions. But in actual sense VASTU is an energy based science. It is basically harmonization of energies in and around the building. VASTU has scientific fundamentals which are universal in nature and can be proved. VASTU emphasizes on staying in harmony with the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The movement of Sun, Moon &amp; Earth, effect of celestial bodies, cosmo telluric channel, geo energies, climate, wind &amp; other natural phenomena’s affect our life drastically. The energies and vibrations around us have subtle impact on the body.</p>
<h3><strong><em><u>Sun</u></em></strong></h3>
<p>Sun being the center of the solar system, governs multiple forces in it. It affects our life immensely. It is known that in summer sun rises from northeast east, in equinox from east and in winters from southeast east. Similarly it sets in northwest west in summer, west in equinox and southwest west in winters. That is why we see longer days than nights in summer.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">The fixed time of sunrise is morning whereby the fixed place of sunrise is east. Similarly the fixed time of sunset is evening whereby the fixed place of sunset is west. At the noon time the Sun is always in South with highest heat and glare. The most interesting phenomena is to observe morning in context to east, noon in context to south and evening in context to west. The most sensitive issues of life and connect are lying in connect with nature.</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>When we observe sunrise we notice high level of thermal and visual comfort in northeast throughout the day. The sun moves from northeast and slowly reaches east which is the permanent place of sun rise throughout the year. It is also important to understand, what people feel, at the time of sunrise.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12"> People, who see sunrise frequently, feel active, energetic, positive and fresh throughout the day. It is also seen that people develop better concentration and connectivity levels at the time of sunrise. Now if a building has adequate opening in north east &amp; east, the morning rays of the sun enter into the room through windows and doors and create a permanent positive environment inside. It is not just thermal comfort, visual comfort, value of light, cool air, less noise and cool albedo but infact a complete connect of self with nature. Sun also makes the northeast &amp; east part of the building active, energetic, positive, full of concentration and connectivity. This means if the building is balanced as per the laws of nature due to adequate openings in east &amp; north east of the building will be active, energetic &amp; certainly positive.</div>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>Sun moves and reaches southeast; almost by noon (time varies). At this point of time sun creates an irritant and unbearable heat. But the positive part of the rays of the sun is that they are disinfectant. The sunlight has high level of heat &amp; energy that makes it competent enough to be disinfectant.</p>
<p>Sun reaches southwest of the building in the early evening. West direction is the direction of setting sun which is stable, relaxing and restful. Sun does not reach North therefore they turn out to be cool zones with cool light. North direction enjoys indirect cool and diffused light of sun. It is a place for day time rooms as it is blessed with thermal and visual comfort throughout the day.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">Green Building Criteria’s (GRIHA- Criteria 13&amp;14) emphasize on thermal and visual comfort in context to directions.It is observed that even on the grounds of sun various room placements in a building can be done. The most important observation is creation of internal environment by Nature, and replicated impact on occupants.</div>
<div class="col-md-12"></div>
<div class="col-md-12">The objective of VASTU science is to give best to each functionality or use in a particular area for example concentration in study room, connectivity in prayer room, natural &amp; disinfectant environment in kitchen, comfort and relaxed environment in bed room and contamination free environment in bathroom &amp; toilet. This would improve the performance level of each activity and generate better level of efficiency with good results.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>River Ganga is the longest river in India and one amongst the longest river of the world. It originates as a pure source of water from Himalayas and after travelling a huge course of land merges into Bay of Bengal. It is the river that has made civilization of Northern and Eastern India flourish. In Hinduism River Ganga is regarded as Goddess and therefore called as <strong>“Ganga Ji” or “Ganga Mata”-Mother Ganga</strong>. It is believed that the holy water of River Ganga has purifying and sanctifying virtues. At Haridwar, one can see huge crowds taking bath in River Ganga to get the divine blessings. Just before entering Haridwar, River Ganga crosses a valley town called as Rishikesh where one can come across people meditating, performing yoga, and yagnas on mountainous banks of River Ganga. One feels refreshed after spending time on banks of River Ganga at Rishikesh.<br />
In today’s world, despite being so holy River Ganga faces a major problem of pollution. Bank erosion is one of the prominent features due to urbanisation and felling of tree. As it leaves mountains and crosses towns and cities, wastes from homes, industries find its way into River Ganga.<br />
Present Indian government led by Prime Minister of India, Shree Narender Modi has launched a mission called “Namami Gange” (that means “We bow to you, Ganga” in Sanskrit) which is an integrated Ganga conservation that will consolidate existing ongoing efforts and planning on Ganga rejuvenation.<br />
A special “Clean Ganga Fund” has been setup to finance various activities. This includes R &amp; D as well as innovative pilot projects for new technology and processes for river purification and conservation.<br />
We at 360° Wellness Solutions intend to promote the cleaning and saving of River Ganga by increasing the awareness of local people and visitors and participating in different efforts being done by various organisations.<br />
If you we wish to donate a token amount of money that would help the initiative further, we would request you to visit the following link setup the Indian Government.<br />

Let us all take a resolution of protecting the most pious River Ganga from pollution so that future generations should also be able to experience and enjoy the blessings and benefits being given by River Ganga.</p>

<p>This article is about the qualities of judging and reacting &#8211; why be a spectator of the worldly things, said in Bhagwad Gita.. As long as we judge and react and that too without empathy, we cannot see the truth in the world.</p>
</div>
<p><span id="more-430"></span></p>
<p>After completing duration of exile when Pandavas return to their kingdom and are denied handover of Indraprastha to them by Kaurvas, Mahabharta (war epic) is ensued. When negotiation for peace between Kaurvas and Pandavas had broken down, Krishna had revealed his Virat Swarup (divine cosmic form) as Vishnu to both Dhritarashtra and Duryodhana by providing momentarily eyes to Dhritrashtra. However, due to having deep grudges along with a feeling of being victim Dhritarashtara stated being helpless, and Duryodhona declaring it as a magician’s trick. Since they made a judgement and clung to the view that they were the victims, showing did not guarantee seeing. Eyes denied seeing the reality and brain chose to select an excuse for not accepting the reality. This in turn to a massive war. Had they not made a judgement, egos would have been brought down and peace could have been negotiated.<br />
As two armies readies to clash-Dhrithrashtra speaks:<br />
“O Sanjaya, tell me what is going on between my sons and sons of Pandu, as they gather in holy fields of Kurukshetra”-Bhagwad Gita: Chapter 1, Verse 1<br />
Again here, Dhritrashtra’s absence of empathy towards his brother’s son is more reflected than his blindness. Being head of the family he wanted to know about the clash between two armies for a tip of piece of land, here exclusion of his brother’s son is clearly noted when he describes them as Pandu’s sons and not his brother’s sons. Here a head of family clearly specifies mine and not mine due to many reasons created by himself.<br />
Judgement leads to feeling of right/wrong, mine/not mine and finally to the battlefield of egos. Whereas Gita discourse was given by Shri Krishna when Arjuna gets in dilemma after realizing that his enemy is his family. He even wanted to have peace at that point of time. Then Shri Krishna makes him realize that it’s the part of previous life’s baggage.<br />
If we observe it as a part of a game there would not be any judgements; different rules; separation of right and wrong; and most importantly there would be absence of feeling of mine and not mine. Peace will rule.<br />
Therefore, for being a good spectator, it is really important that we have empathy (ability to understand and share the feelings of other) towards other and do not make judgements about others, or allege right or wrong. This will ensure a peaceful and healthy life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific VastuTM<br />
LETS LEARN FROM OUR GLORIOUS PAST<br />
VASTU is a science of harmonious manifestation of energy into matter or vice versa.</p>
<p>Art of living in harmony with the nature is Vastu science.  It’s a science because it is based on researches/calculations, database &#038; case studies considering the latitude, longitude and altitude of the place, climatology, land, location, subtle energies around and psychology of occupants.  It has been practised since Vedic times and can be followed by people of any religion.  It’s a science and not any kind of magic .</p>
<p>Balancing building with the laws of nature is known as Vastu science.  Buildings designed by Vastu should be nature friendly building and perfectly balanced withsubtle energies around and five elements and natural environment.  Vaastu was mainly known as Sthapatya Veda or the Science of architecture.  Vastu also has vas experiences and expertise of thousand of years of our ancestors on the relationship between building, nature and their effects.</p>
<p>Real Vastu – It needs a thorough scientific study of building in totality and with help of instruments, it also requires analysis of its occupants.  There are mainly three factors that are required to be taken into consideration:</p>
<p>Building – It refers to the premises and each and every aspect of the premises.  This includes the structure, openings, location, size, shape, internal layout and environment etc.  A complete internal and external study of the dwellings is important.</p>
<p>Human beings – This refers to the occupants of the building.  It refers to a complete psychological and anatomical study of the occupants.  The attitude, behavior and personality of the occupants play an important role in customized solutions.</p>
<p>Environment – Environment refers to both internal and external environment. The external environment includes the surrounding, aggressions, Climatology, cosmic and geo energies etc. The internal environment comprises of indoor air, electromagnetic field, multiple chemical sensitivity, colour scheme, materials and furniture etc.  The relationship between internal and external environment should also be clearly understood to strike a perfect balance.</p>
<p>Many of the benefits that are easily possible through efficient Scientific Vastu are:</p>
<p>Sound sleep<br />
Increased efficiency, comfort level, relaxation, concentration, and mental stability.<br />
Open mindedness.<br />
Strong immune system, better energy levels, fresh &#038; active feel and improved relationships are some of them.</p>
<p>The research scholars &#038; experts associated have differentiated themselves from the general AstroVaastu Consultants.  They have made the building fraternity realize that Architectural Vaastu science is a core subject of building sciences.  It concentrates on creating a Healthy internal environment and provides healing to the buildings through colours, plants, music’s, aromas, crystals, , paintings and design concepts.</p>

<p>Manda explores what deepening our yoga practice (or Sadhana) entails, reflecting on her own journey and seeking insight from Patanjali&#8217;s Yoga Sutras.</p>
</div>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><strong>Deepen</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>to become, or to cause something to become, stronger or more powerful</em></li>
<li>t<em>o make something fuller or more complete</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sadhana</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>conscious spiritual practice</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>The focus on the physical</h2>
<h3><em>Yoga is an internal practice the rest is just a circus </em><em>~ </em><em>Sri Pattabhi Jois</em></h3>
<p>As I began thinking about what deepening our Sadhana meant I reflected on my own journey over the last thirteen years and what might be the critical distillations. I also sought some insight from Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras which will follow.</p>
<p>For many of us our entry point into yoga was Asana (yoga poses). Typically, progression takes on the momentum of ‘excelling’ in certain postures, milestones are reached when we can finally touch your toes or balance in <a href="https://www.ekhartyoga.com/everything-yoga/yoga-poses/crow-pose">Crow pose</a> (see picture).</p>
<p>We might have associated deepening our Sadhana with advancing our yoga postures, i.e. getting stronger and more flexible. Of course there is nothing wrong with that, but in my opinion the practice of yoga is so rich and there are so many gems to be discovered beyond the physical postures.</p>
<h2>Asking the right questions</h2>
<h3><em>The style of asana practice we first embarked on might not be the asana practice that continues to serve us over the years.</em></h3>
<p>As we practise over months and years, we can go deeper by listening and responding to what the mind and body are communicating to us about the practice we are engaged in. How is our breath maintained throughout the practice? How are our energy levels sustained and regulated during our practice? Do we leave energised? Depleted? Where is our head at whilst we are practicing? Distracted? Absorbed? Do we look forward to arriving? Or are we more excited for it to be over? Is our practice a chore? Are we driven to practice out of obligation or fear? Or do we genuinely arrive on our mats grateful and excited to be there? Are we willing to question our practice, to take a step back and become curious about what experience we are having and whether the experience is beneficial to ourselves and to our relationships?</p>
<blockquote><p>Are we willing to question our practice, to take a step back and become curious about what experience we are having and whether the experience is beneficial to ourselves and to our relationships?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Motivation and intention</h2>
<h3><em>Which brings us to a fundamental question… What is yoga to you?</em></h3>
<p>What experience are you pursuing and how do your choices on and (maybe more importantly!) off the mat contribute toward your yoga?</p>
<p>Knowing your motivation and your intention keeps you on your path. It’s very easy to get distracted by the shoulds and musts, getting drawn into practices because everyone else is, flitting from one practice to another because the resistance you meet feels too uncomfortable – only to meet it again in a different guise.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s very easy to get drawn into practices because everyone else is, flitting from one practice to another because the resistance you meet feels too uncomfortable – only to meet it again in a different guise.</p></blockquote>
<p>I remember acquiring book after book looking for THE answer to all my problems, somewhere between pages 20 to 50 the answer was given…. cultivating a meditation practice. Nope, that was not the answer I was looking for, so I put down one book and purchased another, THE one that would give me THE Right answer. No prizes for guessing how this played out&#8230;</p>
<h2>Taking responsibility</h2>
<h3><em>The previous question brings yet another question…. How significant are the details of the practice?</em></h3>
<p>What are the constituents or necessary ingredients for you to create your experience of yoga? How rigid or flexible are those elements? Again another open question.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, I would arrive at class as a consumer with the expectation that it was the teacher’s responsibility to make yoga to happen for me, to me, even. At times I left disappointed, I didn’t work in the way I wanted to yet I was unwilling to take responsibility for my own practice in this way. TKV Desikachar’s words echo in my mind, ‘<em>Finally, I must become my own therapist’</em>.</p>
<p>When I was studying to become a yoga teacher, part of my Sadhana project and final essay was to ‘abstain’ from going to a yoga class for a month and instead develop and deepen my self-practice at home. This is what I felt my yoga needed to evolve and grow. And this is responsibility – the ability to respond to our fluctuating internal experiences, our forever changing external circumstances and identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for us to experience yoga.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is responsibility – the ability to respond to our fluctuating internal experiences, our forever changing external circumstances and identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for us to experience yoga.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Looking to Patanjali</h2>
<h3>Practice with consistency</h3>
<p>Master Patanjali offers us two core principles to apply towards our yoga practice elucidated in Yoga Sutras 1.12-1.16. Patanjali does not tell us what to do, but how to engage with our practice. The first principle is <em>Abhyasa</em>: to practice with consistency, to constantly choose the appropriate practices and exertion of effort for us to access <strong>our</strong> yoga. Once more we are met by a teaching that does not prescribe the <em>whats</em> but insists upon the <em>hows; </em>it&#8217;s about<em> </em>approach rather than technique. A consistent and sincere enquiry, questioning, curiosity and unwavering commitment to your Sadhana.</p>
<h3>Practice with non attachment</h3>
<p>The second principle is <a href="https://www.ekhartyoga.com/blog/aparigraha-practicing-non-attachment"><em>Vairagya</em></a> – non-attachment, a gradual letting go of our preferences, our likes and dislikes, the colourings that oxymoronically dull the mind. When the mind clings to something it becomes rigid and inflexible, we calcify and become narrow in our perspective. By taking an expansive and open-minded approach we experience more freedom and liberation and we are less disappointed by the outcomes of things not going our way.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the mind clings to something it becomes rigid and inflexible, we calcify, we become narrow in our perspective. By taking an expansive and open position we experience more freedom and liberation.</p></blockquote>
<p>We feel less entitled in other words: ‘what can you or the universe do for me and my preferences?’ Instead within the vastness and breadth of our non-attachment lies so much opportunity and possibility. So much room for growth and transformation. So much space for yoga to happen. What is more, a pace is implied in these teachings.</p>
<p>Patanjali does not suggest it’s a quick fix, microwavable enlightenment in biodegradable packaging. Critically, what is proposed is consistency over time and a gradual letting go and shedding of the layers of our preferences. In this way I feel the marriage and application of the two companion principles Abhyasa and Vairagya is complete and profound</p>
