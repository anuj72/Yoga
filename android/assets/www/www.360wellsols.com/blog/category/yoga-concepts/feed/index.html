				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yoga originated in India, it is group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices. Yoga come from the the root word “Yuj”, which means “Union” – “The touching of the inner soul with the Universal Soul”. It is practiced by different religions. It is not just an exercise, but offers chance to balance mind and body. Deep breathing is the simplest form of yoga and its benefits are tremendous, so the mild to advanced yoga if practiced in a correct way can provide us with a healthy body and mind. The most well-known types of yoga are “Hatha yoga and Rāja yoga”.<br />
Yoga is a holistic science and an art of living which aims to achieve optimum physical, mental, emotional and spiritual equilibrium, and finally unite the self with the supreme self.<br />
It is often said that with practice (Abhyasa) and detachment (Vairagya) one can control the mind.<br />
Patanjali Yoga Sutra aptly defines Yoga as a ‘Science of controlling the fluctuations of the mind by Abhyasa and Vairagya’.<br />
Yoga also means bringing awareness to what one is doing – BE IN THE PRESENT.<br />
Swami Vivekananda once said – “Each soul is potentially divine; the goal is to manifest this divinity, either by work (Karma Yoga), worship (Bhakti Yoga), intellect (Gyana Yoga), or by psychic control (Raja Yoga)<br />
Gandhiji – “Yoga is what you think, what you say, and what you do”<br />
Mediation is an intricate part of Yo0ga and is one of its 8 limbs. The 8 limbs or stambhas of Yoga are as follows:<br />
• Yamas – Self regulating behaviours<br />
• Ahimsa (Compassion for all)<br />
• Satya (Truthfulness)<br />
• Asatya (Not stealing)<br />
• Brahamacharya (Merging one’s energy with the ONE)<br />
• Aparaigraha (Non-greed)</p>
<p>• Niyamas – Personal beliefs/practices<br />
• Saucha (Purity)<br />
• Santosha (Contentment)<br />
• Tapas (Self discipline)<br />
• Svadhyaya (Self study; introspection)<br />
• Ishwara-Pranidhana (Surrender to God)<br />
• Asanas – Postures<br />
• Pranayama – Breathing exercises and techniques<br />
• Prataharas – Control of the senses<br />
• Dharana – Concentration<br />
• Dhyaana – Meditation<br />
• Samadhi – Super-conscious state</p>
<p>We have Yoga practitioners working with us who assess and guide visitors as per their needs; and we also arrange retreats for group in Himalayas. Come to the land of Yoga to experience and learn Yoga authentically.</p>
