				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colour therapy is as old as any other medicine in oldest civilizations and has been used in India, Egypt, Greece, and China. It is believed to have been investigated as medicine since 2000 BC. In that age society might have been unaware of colour’s effect as a medicine, but surely had faith in healing with colours. Primary colours red, blue and yellow were used for healing. The science seems to have been silent at those times.</p>
<p>It is believed that body’s seven chakras are related to the seven colours of the rainbow. Therefore, it is believed that if harmony of colours is disturbed in the body it leads to disorders in the body, and after getting diagnosed by a colour therapist that particular disorder can be treated by appropriate spectrum of colours. Here light moves in waves of varying lengths and, as each colour has a different wavelength and a particular spectrum is focussed on. This is done in a specially designed rooms by throwing that of colours on walls, by shoning up light on skin, treating water in glass bottles with colours, or may be through small torches.</p>
<p>Evidence of colour therapy has been seen on mood and general well being. Robert Gerard in 1958 conducted a study that showed the power of stimulation by red and makes anxious and affected appetite, blood pressure, and aggression; while blue promoted calmness.</p>
<p>Ghadiali research stated “The colour bands of spectrograms are produced when a chemical element undergoes a process of combustion or vaporization that accelerates the motion of its atoms. The specific band of colours and dark lines emitted when a certain element is heated, are known as Fraunhauafer.” He also found that “by treating the body with a particular colour vibration, one could effectively reintroduce the appropriate biochemical elements into the body; he referred to this as colour chemistry, certainly a new field of study. His results as published in the first decade of the twentieth century were advocated by Klotsche (1) in Colour Medicine: colour medicine not only can heal the diseased frequency of the body but also can introduce actual chemical elements/vibration into the body in a non-toxic form.”</p>
<p>Journal published by Samina T. Yousuf Azeemi and S. Mohsin Raza states “Chromotherapy as a system of treatment can benefit people because of its harmony with nature. Everything that exists in this world is a combination of different colours”</p>
<p>Consultant psychologist Ingrid Collins states “We know that the cells of the human body are constructed from atoms and that each atom consists of particles of energy in constant motion. We are therefore at the most fundamental level made of energy and information, so when we add a particular colour we are adding energy into our lives.”</p>
<p>It is being used in Texas, there inmates are dressed in pink to reduce aggression. It is being widely used for treating insomnia, stress, immune deficiency problems, and also for critical illness. People who have been through this therapy states that after the therapy there is a feeling freshness and many have been helped in case of insomnia.</p>
<p>Explore colours deeply and get rejuvenated!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>“Human that cannot be still will be ill”</h1>
<h2>Human Thougths</h2>
<p>In today’s fast moving world, human thoughts are so much engrossed in technology and fast moving lifestyle. We forget the kind of life, we have been given by divine or nature.  We always needs something much more important than this technology and fast moving lifestyle. Our physical health depends completely on our psychological health. Stillness improves our mental health and thereby our physical health. For example, Tortoise are slow moving animals, and lives a long life, looks like they have stillness and also they complete within themselves.</p>
<h2>Thyroid</h2>
<p>Now talking about this Thyroid hormone, we can say that this hormone is responsible for many things that maintain balance in the body. For example, it is responsible for maintaining the metabolism, sleep cycle, brain activities and/or the bone maintenance. To keep it healthy few major things are required to be done by humans.</p>
<p>Firstly, <strong>relieve yourself from getting engrossed with technology and slow down </strong>and focus on what you have been doing till now. Start having more control on yourself and let your soul take control of your body and not the vice versa. <strong>Start focussing on your breath and breathe deeply and slowly, so that Thyroid gland is released from the pressure </strong>of generating the required hormones extremely quickly. Always keep an extra margin in time while going for some work or commitment so that you don’t get stressed and breathing does not disturbed.</p>
<p>Secondly, let your <strong>body and eyes interact with early morning sunlight</strong>, since apart from providing Vitamin D to your body, it will help to set your circadian rhythm that in turn control the release of cortisol in your body. Current researches show that high cortisol levels decrease our body’s ability to convert T4 to T3, and also due to <strong>delayed sleep cycle melatonin influences the release of Thyroid stimulating hormone</strong>. Thereby, we start having impact on Thyroid, weight, and our thought process.</p>
<p>Now talking about our major concern that how <strong>thoughts impact our Thyroid gland</strong>. Think of a thing or a scene deeply and you will certainly start having an appropriate hormone release. For example if we watch an action movie or a comedy movie, hormone released will be different; if we think of a thick forest with snakes, a different hormone will be released; if we visualise mountains with river and cool breeze blowing then certainly a special health improving hormone can be released. Now, we need to understand that the Thyroid gland is the gland that will get signals to produce appropriate hormone which could be a hormone that improves our health or a hormone that depletes our health. I think by now we are on the same page that <strong>everything depends on the type of thoughts we think of. </strong></p>
<p>Therefore, when we wish something and keep our Thyroid gland under pressure and keep of thinking that continuously will start having a negative impact on the gland. Therefore, wishing something materialistic for our better future is good, however, pressure on our gland to be perfect and our goal to achieve should be taken care of in a balanced manner, and in place of keeping our gland under pressure we should keep happy and consider it as a game and accept the consequences happily. That attitude is also termed as being <strong>“happy going lucky” or we also call it as “Divine’s plan” for us</strong>. Furthermore, we should <strong>stop “negative self-talking” </strong>to stop impacting our Thyroid gland to produce stress hormones. In addition to this, <strong>ANGER is </strong>our biggest enemy and it would be acting like a biggest size of boulder on all our glands.</p>
<p>It’s an irony in today’s world that first in search of perfection we deliberately disturb our hormonal balance, and then that hormonal dysfunction starts disturbing us. Even then if we open our eyes, we can stop short of this above mentioned collateral damage. By saying being aware, I mean that we should start understanding human life and nature. Few things that could help us are: Breathing exercises, Mudra practice, Yoga and meditation, observing nature, and following the Sun and regulating our sleep cycle accordingly, no negative talking or thinking, and controlling anger.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Consciousness</h2>
<p>Human consciousness can be compared with flowing water, as the temperature goes does down it contracts water into ice that is a solid state, and as when temperature rises it becomes liquid state.<span id="more-1891"></span></p>
<p>When water in a river is in liquid state it usually flows, can adjust itself in any space, remain independent but still united with other droplets,splash together, and even flow in one direction making its way within the harsh terrain like mountains.  However, the same water on decreasing temperature turns it into ice which in turn gets segregated into different blocks that usually stays in a same place and hits against other blocks of ice.  Water gushes into other water bodies and merges itself smoothly into other water bodies, whereas, ice hits other ice blocks and leads to collateral damage.</p>
<p>This can be compared with expanding consciousness and contractive consciousness.  As the conscious energy gets low and our consciousness contracts and become similar to ice, we as humans tend to divide ourselves; start being selfish;ignore divine and nature; build higher egos; misunderstand others; pretend to be superior to others;blame others; hurt others; and tend to get hurt easily.</p>
<p>However, as this ice melts and there is high flow of energy that expands our consciousness, we start realising the world as the divine has designed it;appreciate every activity and plans of divine and nature; feel the flow of divine love within our warm hearts towards others; expand our vision; start adjusting in different situations;smile, forgive and forget very easily; wherever we go people feel more comfortable and are attracted towards us just like iron gets attracted to a magnet;we avoid hurting others and never get hurt.  This enables a person to live a “happy go lucky” lifestyle.</p>
<p>Consciousness creates reality and affects our outer world, expanding our consciousness will be certainly helpful for our families, societies, and countries.  When we merge and cooperate with each other at the level of countries, communities, or families;our vision would expand and we will flow smoothly that would enable us to progress exponentially by getting more opportunities and cracking them with synergised energies.  This is the time that we all should take a lead within ourselves in thinking and acting actively in increasing the lowered energy levels to expand our consciousness.  Different approaches like meditation; yoga; exercise; social interaction; and understanding and appreciating different sects of communities should be opted together in a Sahaja (easy) manner.This would ensue warmth in relationships of countries, communities, and families.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Naturally recurring altered consciousness of mind and body is known as sleeping. Dozing is composed of a series cycles of 90-minute during which brain moves from deep, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep to REM sleep. This cycle is generally stable throughout the night. However, ratio of non-REM to REM sleep changes. Head of the Sleep and Neuroimaging Lab at the University of California, Berkeley, Dr. Matt Walker explains that “non-REM sleep tends to dominate slumber cycles in the early part of the night. But as clock creeps toward daybreak, REM sleep muscles in.” That can be considered significant, because as per some researches non-REM sleep is deeper and more restorative than lighter, dream-infused REM sleep, however, both offer important benefits.<span id="more-1842"></span></p>
<p>We have window of several hours between 8 pm till 12 am, during this our brain has the chance to get all REM and non-REM cycles.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect bedtime:</strong><br />
Dr. Matt Walker further explains that the regardless of when one goes to bed, shift from non-REM to REM sleep happens at certain times of the night. Therefore if someone hit the bed very late, for example 3 AM-sleep will certainly tilt toward REM-heavy sleep. Reduction in deep, restorative sleep may leave you groggy, tired, and blunt-minded the next day. Negative thoughts easily enter a tired and groggy mind.</p>
<p>One study shows, people had lower scores on standardized tests of memory and processing speed had an experience working at night. People who had a decade or more of shift work or going to sleep late in the night experience had such pronounced cognitive deficits that were equivalent to about 6.5 years of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>It’s not a good idea that to learn to work at night and sleep during the day. Body’s circadian rhythms that regulate everything from sleeping patterns to energy levels through thyroid hormone, digestion, movement of bowels, and hunger levels tells brain the time to go to sleep as per day pattern. It’s considered to be not natural to reset or reschedule circadian rhythms when it comes to bedtime.</p>
<p><strong>Duration of sleep:</strong><br />
As per National Sleep Foundation recommendation adults should get the following amount of sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adults — 7.5 to 9 hours daily.</li>
<li>Older Adults 65+ — 7 to 8 hours daily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shortened sleep has many effects, people who slept for five hours a night for just a week<br />
had a higher heart rate during the day as per one of the recent study.</p>
<p>As per study from Paul Kelley and Oxford University, ideal wakeup time when we are in our<br />
20s is 9:30 a.m.; in our 30s is 8 a.m.; in our 40s is 7:30 a.m.; in our 50s is 7 a.m.; and in 60s 6:30 a.m.</p>
<p>As per one of the traditional medicines, from 11pm to 3am most of your blood circulation<br />
concentrates in your liver that helps in detoxification process. Liver then neutralizes and breaks<br />
down body toxins accumulated throughout the day. Therefore sleeping at this for the smooth<br />
process to be carried becomes very important. It is believed that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going to sleep at 11pm, have full 4 hours to detoxify your body.</li>
<li>Going to sleep at 12am, you have 3 hours.</li>
<li>Going to sleep at 1am, you have 2 hours.</li>
<li>And going to sleep at 2am, you only have 1 hour to detoxify.</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been researched that sleeping late and/or less than 7.5 hours of sleep daily can lead to chronic<br />
health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, impaired brain activity, depression, memory<br />
problems, cognitive dysfunction, weight gain, impact on child bearing, hallucinations, thyroid<br />
disorder, and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Dr. Matt Walker says that it is very paramount for everyone specifically students, child<br />
bearing females, and 60+ aged adults to understand the ideal sleep time and duration for living a<br />
healthy and prosperous life, he further adds that people suffering from different medical condition<br />
ranging from fever, pregnancy, endocrinal disorder specially the thyroid disorder, and cardio<br />
disorder etc. to heed to the advice and take care of their sleeping time and duration to avoid any<br />
further deterioration and recover quickly.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Vigour, an attitude of forgiveness towards others, courage, purity, goodwill, towards others, and freedom from pride. All of these, dear Arjuna, are considered by Me to be the great characteristics of a man who possesses a divine nature and has come into this world from heaven.” &#8211; Gita Ch.16 Shloka 03<br />
<span id="more-1772"></span>“Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us”-Lord’s Prayer</p>
<p>In our daily lives, forgiveness is the biggest medicine that helps in achieving contentment and promotes wellness. Do we want to waste our prized life in causing discomfort to others, expecting a lot from others, hurting and getting hurt by others, and keeping our hearts heavily filled with grudges against others? Do we really have time to find fault in others? In a way by forgiving others, we let go negative thoughts thereby making our mind, heart, and body light and connect with joy.</p>
<p>The capability of forgiving others and expecting less from others shows the level of control we have on our mind and lives. Many consider forgiveness as a sign of weakness, however, in reality it is easier to retaliate whereas forgiving require lots of thoughtful practice. Individual can be hurt by a mistake of others or it might be due to misunderstanding, so if an individual forgives and moves on, the cause of anger can be rectified later on with love.</p>
<p>Not forgiving people and reacting to each action of others negatively can make our lives miserable; obviously, it would lead to different levels of anger every time, and it would create too many negative thoughts in our mind that in turn will only harm our bodily systems in long run starting from fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and heart disease. For example, if an individual has a habit of finding the negative most things in others and not understanding their action, then he or she will develop a habit of getting offended and reacting negatively to every second thing.</p>
<p>Not forgiving truly is a recipe for poor health and bitterness, since we carry bag of grudges and have the tendency to build on the most negative part of those replaying memories we tend to get angry easily the next time anyone repeats the same kind of action and this cycle keeps going on and we start thinking in a negative manner towards society. In case we know the person then we should also remind ourselves of the good deeds performed by that person towards us.</p>
<p>To promote wellness in our routine lives, whenever we think a mistake has been committed by others, we should hold our response and try to understand the reason or point of view of that person, in case the mistake was deliberate even then we should not take the offense and we should make ourselves safe and forgive others.</p>
<p>We should realise that forgiving others is for our own betterment and self-interest. Once we start seeing the benefits of forgiving by achieving mental and physical balance, we would realise that by<br />
forgiving others easily we tend to save energy, time, and health. Getting less offended and forgiving more can add a fresh level of joyful energies in our relationships.<br />
“To have a joyous life, get released from this suffocation of resentment, and start smiling and forgiving others. – Dr. Gaurav Malik</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Ayurveda is world’s oldest healing science that was devised by lord Dhanvantari and has been used for thousands of years by rishis and doctors.  It has proved to be very useful system of prevention and healing and attaining wellness.  In this system importance of physical and mental balance, emotional release, spiritual growth and environmental mindfulness has been recognised.  Ayurvedic system has been promulgated by lord Dhanvantari.  As per BhagwataPurana, Dhanvantari emerged from Ocean of Milk along with pot of elixir for immortality during SagarManthan.<span id="more-1748"></span></p>
<p>Ayurveda can be used by all people in all climates.  Ayurveda uses natural forces like herbs, diet, heat, cold, minerals, exercise, oils, and meditation to help attain wellness from illness.  It is believed in Ayurveda that health results from harmony within one’s self; that is to say your health depends on your thoughts, feelings, trust on others, and satisfaction.  This harmony further manifests externally as harmony with family, friends, co-workers, juniors, society, and nature.  In case a human is not in harmony within one’s self it would manifest the same with others before showing the signs and symptoms of disease.  Ayurveda being an optimistic science considers the manifestation of symptoms and disease as positive development since it is considered as a call to change for a positive attitude and gives a person a chance to either change from inside or go in for an overhaul, however, for this to happen a person has to dedicatedly work on mind to generate positive thoughts internally that would be manifested as healthy body and healthy relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example an individual “A” who remains quiet, keeps on smiling and might not do things with absolute perfection might be just due to he is in peace within himself, however, he might be considered as mysterious and imperfect personality in today’s modern world.  In contrast to this there might be a personality “B” who might be energetic, does everything with perfection would be appreciated for work by outer world, however, from inside this type of personality might not be in peace with self.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Ayurvedic therapy system considers human to be made up of five elements and considers to be miniature of universe, that is to say that the vastness of universe lies within humans.  Five elements are Earth, Fire, Water, Air, and Ether.  Now these five elements combine in pairs to form three doshas or life forces.  The dynamism of this makes life happen.  Ether and Air makes up Vata.  Fire and water makes up Pitta.  Water and earth makes up Kapha.  These three forces keep on changing dynamically to make life happen.  These forces are influenced by the thoughts, environment, diet, lifestyle, and time of the day.  When all these factors are in sync with nature and in line with betterment of living being produces beautiful impacts.  The Ayurvedic therapies have been designed to balance out these forces, however, before applying any of the therapy a complete consultation is required since every body type is unique and a Doctor or Vedacharya can only decide the appropriate therapy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To conclude, we can say that Ayurveda being one of the finest medical sciences teaches us that everything is within us, and by taking a positive outlook and ignoring the negative happenings, we should be able to get the best results out of us.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Make peace with ourselves, energise our bodies, positively stimulate our mind, and calm our soul.”-Gaurav Malik</p>
